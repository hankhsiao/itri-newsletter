                      <div class="figcaption" style="color: gray; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px; max-width: 500px;">The interface displays minimal features to improve usability.</div>
                    </div>
                  <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
                    Haptic interfaces have been readily adopted because of their intuitive ease of use and convenience. Obvious examples are the screens for your mobile phone or other computing devices where keyboards have been eliminated. This technology, which has been welcomed in everyday life, can also find a home in scientific research, especially in the case of &quot;point and click&quot; interfaces. The haptic interface provides the immediate &quot;front end&quot;. An equally powerful and parallel development has been cloud computing technology, where information and processing power can be shared between multiple users. The combination of these two technologies can provide both ease of use in information analysis and a wide area of application in sharing and making use of the analysis. Point and click interfaces are common in many forms of instrumentation. An image is displayed and a human operator interprets that image, together with any associated data, feeding back results with the motion and click of a mouse and sometimes keyboard data entry. In the field of X-ray crystallography, the initial images that need to be interpreted are typically experiments aimed at the crystallisation of biological macromolecules. Each is viewed and classified in order to guide and optimise crystallisation efforts. If success occurs in the crystallisation step, another application of imaging occurs and the images of mounted crystals are used to position them appropriately with respect to the X-ray beam for diffraction analysis. For limited studies, point and click interfaces are convenient, but as the number of images involved begin to increase, even these user-friendly interfaces can become burdensome. At the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute, the High-Throughput Crystallisation Screening Centre provides a crystallisation screening service sampling 1536 different chemical conditions. If a potential crystal is identified, the laboratory providing the sample then conducts optimisation experiments centred around the screening results. Once optimised, the resulting crystals are used for diffraction studies. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- Scientific Computing, 2016/12/12</span>

                    What does it take to understand a black hole, those amazing astronomical features at the center of every galaxy, including our Milky Way? A lot of complex computational science done on supercomputers by researchers like Professor Jim Stone at Princeton University. Dr. Stone is Chair of Princeton’s Astrophysics Department. He is also director of the Princeton Institute for Computational Science and Engineering, or PICSciE (pronounced pik-see) and is a professor in both the Astrophysics Department and in the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics (PACM).
 “One of the areas of focus in my research is black holes,” said Dr. Stone. “I’m mostly interested in astrophysical gas dynamics and computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) for astrophysical plasmas, because most of the visible matter that you can see in astrophysical systems is a plasma. Stars, galaxies, and interstellar media are plasmas. If you want to understand their dynamics and structure and be able to interpret images from telescopes, you have to model the gas, magnetic field, radiation transport and other physics in the flows. We do that using thousands of cores on big supercomputers.”
 MHD is magnetohydrodynamics, which is an extension of fluid dynamics. Plasmas are electrically conducting fluids, so they respond to magnetic fields. But they are also affected by photons, so radiation transport also impacts their dynamics and structures. “That’s one substantial difference between modeling astrophysical plasmas and modeling terrestrial flows, like water or airplanes in flight. You don&#x27;t need to worry about these things in terrestrial flows. Incorporating MHDs and radiation transport increases the complexity of our systems of equations by about an order of magnitude beyond terrestrial flows,” added Stone. All these properties are modeled in 3D space over time in complex systems of partial differential equations (PDEs), which generate as much as 100 TBs of data for analysis and visualization. “We’ve been running our computational models on about 250,000 cores on a supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory,” added Stone.
 Over his career, Professor Stone has seen the evolution of computational science and software engineering for astrophysics go from large vector processor machines, to x86 clusters, to vector units in CPUs and now to large vector processing engines again like the Intel® Xeon Phi™ processor (formerly codenamed Knights Landing). “Our codes have evolved over the last 20 years along with the CPU architectures. In the last two years, we&#x27;ve completely rewritten our programs from scratch to take advantage of vector processing in the x86 architecture.” That&#x27;s where his students in PACM and Ian Cosden of Princeton come in to help make those new codes perform up to four times faster than they have to date thanks to some clever optimizations with Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX512) and the Intel Xeon Phi processor. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- Scientific Computing, 2016/12/12</span>

                    To better predict tropical cyclone intensity, scientists sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) recently worked with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to gather atmospheric data from storms that formed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2016. Fully developed tropical cyclones -- variously called hurricanes, typhoons or cyclones, depending on their region--can grow as wide as several hundred miles and sustain winds faster than 150 miles per hour. For example, Typhoon Tip (1979) had 190-mph winds and Hurricane Patricia (2015) whipped up 215-mph winds (the record). Such storms are notoriously difficult to predict, presenting a volatile meteorological cocktail that can change direction, speed and strength, quickly and unexpectedly. They pose a severe threat to U.S. Navy fleet operations--so accurate forecasting is critical for protecting ships at sea, evacuating vulnerable bases, and performing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. &quot;Think about the ships, equipment, people and assets that must be moved to safety before a hurricane hits,&quot; said Dr. Ronald Ferek, a program manager in ONR&#x27;s Ocean Battlespace Sensing Department. &quot;This represents a huge investment of resources. If we can improve the lead time and accuracy of storm forecasts, it would give naval leadership more time and detailed information for preparations, evacuation or shelter-in-place decisions.&quot; The recent research involved flying NASA&#x27;s unmanned Global Hawk planes above hurricanes -- more than 60,000 feet in the air -- and deploying sensor-laden dropsondes. Dropsondes are parachute- and GPS-equipped devices that measure temperature, humidity, moisture, wind speed and direction, pressure and altitude -- crucial factors in determining the potential strength and destructiveness of a hurricane. The Global Hawks flew nine missions this year -- dropping 647 dropsondes -- culminating in three flights above Hurricane Matthew, a Category 5 storm that battered the East Coast in October. ONR is sponsoring efforts by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and several universities to analyze and interpret the collected data, and integrate it into computerized prediction models. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- Scientific Computing, 2016/12/19</span>

                    Taking a swab of your cell phone screen may be able to tell a lot of information about a person, including diet, health status, preferred hygiene products and locations visited. Researchers at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine and Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical were able to construct lifestyle sketches for phone owners by examining the trace chemicals, molecules and microbes on the phones. Senior author Pieter Dorrestein, Ph.D., professor in UC San Diego School of Medicine and Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, said this information could have a number of applications including criminal profiling, airport screening, medication adherence monitoring, clinical trial participant stratification and environmental exposure studies.“You can imagine a scenario where a crime scene investigator comes across a personal object — like a phone, pen or key — without fingerprints or DNA, or with prints or DNA not found in the database. They would have nothing to go on to determine who that belongs to,” he said in a statement. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- R&amp;D Mag, 2016/12/20</span>

                    Throwing a perfect strike in virtual bowling doesn&#x27;t require your gaming system to precisely track the position and orientation of your swinging arm. But if you&#x27;re operating a robotic forklift around a factory, manipulating a mechanical arm on an assembly line or guiding a remote-controlled laser scalpel inside a patient, the ability to pinpoint exactly where it is in three-dimensional (3-D) space is critical. To make that measurement more reliable, a public-private team led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has created a new standard test method to evaluate how well an optical tracking system can define an object&#x27;s position and orientation--known as its &quot;pose&quot;--with six degrees of freedom: up/down, right/left, forward/backward, pitch, yaw and roll. Optical tracking systems work on a principle similar to the stereoscopic vision of a human. A person&#x27;s two eyes work together to simultaneously take in their surroundings and tell the brain exactly where all of the people and objects within that space are located. In an optical tracking system, the &quot;eyes&quot; consist of two or more cameras that record the room and are partnered with beam emitters that bounce a signal--infrared, laser or LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)--off objects in the area. With both data sources feeding into a computer, the room and its contents can be virtually recreated. Determining the pose of an object is relatively easy if it doesn&#x27;t move, and previous performance tests for optical tracking systems relied solely on static measurements. However, for systems such as those used to pilot automated guided vehicle (AGV) forklifts--the robotic beasts of burden found in many factories and warehouses--that isn&#x27;t good enough. Their &quot;vision&quot; must be 20/20 for both stationary and moving objects to ensure they work efficiently and safely. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- Scientific Computing, 2016/12/12</span>

                    Ultrashort bursts of electrons have several important applications in scientific imaging, but producing them has typically required a costly, power-hungry apparatus about the size of a car. In the journal Optica, researchers at MIT, the German Synchrotron, and the University of Hamburg in Germany describe a new technique for generating electron bursts, which could be the basis of a shoebox-sized device that consumes only a fraction as much power as its predecessors. Ultrashort electron beams are used to directly gather information about materials that are undergoing chemical reactions or changes of physical state. But after being fired down a particle accelerator a half a mile long, they’re also used to produce ultrashort X-rays. Last year, in Nature Communications, the same group of MIT and Hamburg researchers reported the prototype of a small “linear accelerator” that could serve the same purpose as the much larger and more expensive particle accelerator. That technology, together with a higher-energy version of the new “electron gun,” could bring the imaging power of ultrashort X-ray pulses to academic and industry labs. Indeed, while the electron bursts reported in the new paper have a duration measured in hundreds of femtoseconds, or quadrillionths of a second (which is about what the best existing electron guns can manage), the researchers’ approach has the potential to lower their duration to a single femtosecond. An electron burst of a single femtosecond could generate attosecond X-ray pulses, which would enable real-time imaging of cellular machinery in action. “We’re building a tool for the chemists, physicists, and biologists who use X-ray light sources or the electron beams directly to do their research,” says Ronny Huang, an MIT PhD student in electrical engineering and first author on the new paper. “Because these electron beams are so short, they allow you to kind of freeze the motion of electrons inside molecules as the molecules are undergoing a chemical reaction. A femtosecond X-ray light source requires more hardware, but it utilizes electron guns.” <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- Scientific Computing, 2016/12/5</span>

                  <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
                    A new way to convert the dangerous chromium-6 into the benign chromium-3 in drinking water has emerged. Daniel Giammar, the Walter E. Browne Professor of Environmental Engineering at the School of Engineering &amp; Applied Science at Washington University in St. Louis has found a new way to convert the carcinogenic form of chromium to the safer form by using a process called electrocoagulation.“Electrocoagulation is the particular approach we used to introduce iron into the water,” Giammar said in a statement. “Typically, you would use an iron salt and physically add a dose to the water.“Electrocoagulation uses two pieces of iron metal in the water, you apply a voltage between them and that is how you dose iron into the water and convert the chromium-6.” Chromium is an odorless, tasteless metallic element that is essential to human health when found in the form of chromium-3. Chromium-3 is found in many vegetables, fruits, meats and grains and is often included in multi-vitamins. However, when in the chromium-6 form it has been known to cause cancer and can contaminate both soil and groundwater. “The health effects are quite well-known,” Giammar said. “It’s very potent as an inhaled contaminant but in drinking water chromium-6 definitely has a negative impact on human health.” Scientists have previously converted chromium-6 to chromium-3 using a chemical process involving iron. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- R&amp;D Mag, 2016/12/21</span>

                    Staff members and students at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), led by RISD professor Michael Lye, have designed a full-scale, wearable model of a space suit designed to be used on the first NASA Mars landing. As Mercury News explains, real space suits are designed to work in zero gravity, so they’re too expensive and too heavy to use. The simulated space suits that are currently used are small, wear out quickly, aren’t comfortable and provide poor ventilation. RISD’s improved version of such a suit is constructed with carbon fiber composite materials and two types of nylon. The suit weight about 45 pounds (135 pounds on Mars) and comes in 16 pieces. The components can be replaced or resized easily to fit whoever is wearing it. Andrzej Stewart, the chief engineering officer of the project, wore the suit for the first time last week and was pleased with the result. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- Composites Manufacturing, 2016/12/12</span>

                    Scientists have spent decades searching for a safe alternative to the flammable liquid electrolytes used in lithium-ion batteries. Now Stanford University researchers have identified nearly two-dozen solid electrolytes that could someday replace the volatile liquids used in smartphones, laptops and other electronic devices. The results, based on techniques adapted from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, are published in the journal Energy &amp; Environmental Science. “Electrolytes shuttle lithium ions back and forth between the battery’s positive and negative electrodes,” said study lead author Austin Sendek, a doctoral candidate in applied physics and first author on the paper. “Liquid electrolytes are cheap and conduct ions really well, but they can catch fire if the battery overheats or is short-circuited by puncturing.” Battery fires led to the recent recall of nearly 2 million Samsung Galaxy Note7 smartphones, the latest in a series of highly publicized lithium-ion battery failures. “The main advantage of solid electrolytes is stability,” Sendek said. “Solids are far less likely to blow up or vaporize than organic solvents. They’re also much more rigid and would make the battery structurally stronger.” <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- Stanford News, 2016/12/15</span>

                    A military drone flying on a reconnaissance mission is captured behind enemy lines, setting into motion a team of engineers who need to remotely delete sensitive information carried on the drone&#x27;s chips. Because the chips are optical and not electronic, the engineers can now simply flash a beam of UV light onto the chip to instantly erase all content. Disaster averted. This James Bond-esque chip is closer to reality because of a new development in a nanomaterial developed by Yuebing Zheng, a professor of mechanical engineering and materials science and engineering in the Cockrell School of Engineering. His team described its findings in the journal Nano Letters on Nov. 10. &quot;The molecules in this material are very sensitive to light, so we can use a UV light or specific light wavelengths to erase or create optical components,&quot; Zheng said. &quot;Potentially, we could incorporate this LED into the chip and erase its contents wirelessly. We could even time it to disappear after a certain period of time.&quot; To test their innovation, the researchers used a green laser to develop a waveguide -- a structure or tunnel that guides light waves from one point to another -- on their nanomaterial. They then erased the waveguide with a UV light, and re-wrote it on the same material using the green laser. The researchers believe they are the first to rewrite a waveguide, which is a crucial photonic component and a building block for integrated circuits, using an all-optical technique. Their main advancement is a specially designed hybrid nanomaterial that is akin to a child&#x27;s Etch-A-Sketch toy -- only the material relies on light and tiny molecules to draw, delete and re-write optical components. Engineers and scientists are interested in rewritable components that use light rather than electricity to carry data because they hold potential for making devices faster, smaller and more energy-efficient than components made from silicon.
The concept of rewritable optics, which underpins optical storage devices such as CDs and DVDs, has been pursued intensely. The drawback to CDs, DVDs and other state-of-the-art rewritable optical components is that they require bulky, stand-alone light sources, optical media and light detectors. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- Scientific Computing, 2016/12/19</span>

                    Neutron scattering studies of a rare earth metal oxide have identified fundamental pieces to the quantum spin liquid puzzle, revealing a better understanding of how and why the magnetic moments within these materials exhibit exotic behaviors such as failing to freeze into an ordered arrangement even near absolute zero temperatures. In a paper published in Nature Physics, a team of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Tennessee and the Department of Energy&#x27;s Oak Ridge National Laboratory used neutrons to examine the origins of unusual magnetic behavior in a rare earth-based metal oxide, ytterbium-magnesium-gallium-tetraoxide (YbMgGaO4). The material, discovered in 2015, is known to have strange magnetic properties, putting it in a unique category of materials classified as quantum spin liquids. &quot;A quantum spin liquid is an exotic state of matter characterized by the entanglement of particles over long distances across the atomic scale,&quot; said lead investigator Martin Mourigal, an assistant physics professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Think of Schrödinger&#x27;s cat, the thought experiment, he said: Many particles participate in a quantum superposition, where multiple quantum states combine to form a new quantum state, and cannot be characterized by the behavior of individual particles. By definition, he said, &quot;it&#x27;s something we can&#x27;t explain with classical physics.&quot;
In a series of experiments at ORNL&#x27;s Spallation Neutron Source, the researchers revealed three key features underpinning the material&#x27;s exotic properties:
antiferromagnetic interactions, where groups of electron spins have an antiparallel alignment with their respective neighbors; spin space anisotropy, meaning that individual magnetic moments strongly prefer aligning themselves alongside specific directions in the material; and chemical disorder between the material&#x27;s magnetic layers that randomizes the interactions between electron spins. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- Scientific Computing, 2016/12/19</span>

                    The cycling industry opened its Cyclitech 2016 International Conference on Bicycle Technology on Dec. 6th, produced jointly by JEC and SPE, in partnership with the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI, Aigle, Switzerland). Following Cyclitech 2015 in Belgium, this year&#x27;s event at the Marriott Hotel in Newport Beach, Calif. opened with a presentation by Mark Barfield, technical manager at UCI, on Simplifying Design Regulations. Bike manufacturers bring new design ideas to UCI for review and discussion, and UCI makes recommendations for new regulations. New designs must conform to the basic definition of a bike as a vehicle with two wheels of equal diameter, with the front wheel steerable, and the rear wheel driven through a system of pedals and a chain. The bike should be recognized as a bike, and built with two triangles. The theme of the conference focused on optimization—of safety, testing, and composite materials and manufacturing processes. The importance of quality control was stressed. Most defects of composite structures—in this case bicycle frames, forks, handlebars and other components—are invisible until the part fails. And failure at the speeds and road conditions experienced in today’s cycling domain can be catastrophic not only to the bike, but to the rider. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- CompositesWorld, 2016/12/19</span>

                    A little sodium goes a long way. At least that&#x27;s the case in carbon-based energy technology. Specifically, embedding sodium in carbon materials can tremendously improve electrodes. A research team led by Yun Hang Hu, the Charles and Carroll McArthur Professor of materials science and engineering at Michigan Tech, created a brand-new way to synthesize sodium-embedded carbon nanowalls. Previously, the material was only theoretical and the journal Nano Letters recently published this invention. High electrical conductivity and large accessible surface area, which are required for ideal electrode materials in energy devices, are opposed to each other in current materials. Amorphous carbon has low conductivity but large surface area. Graphite, on the other hand, has high conductivity but low surface area. Three-dimensional graphene has the best of both properties--and the sodium-embedded carbon invented by Hu at Michigan Tech is even better. &quot;Sodium-embedded carbon&#x27;s conductivity is two orders of magnitude larger than three-dimensional graphene,&quot; Hu says. &quot;The nanowall structure, with all its channels and pores, also has a large accessible surface area comparable to graphene.&quot; This is different from metal-doped carbon where metals are simply on the surface of carbon and are easily oxidized; embedding a metal in the actual carbon structure helps protect it. To make such a dream material, Hu and his team had to create a new process. They used a temperature-controlled reaction between sodium metal and carbon monoxide to create a black carbon powder that trapped sodium atoms. Furthermore, in collaboration with researchers at University of Michigan and University of Texas at Austin, they demonstrated that the sodium was embedded inside the carbon instead of adhered on the surface of the carbon. The team then tested the material in several energy devices. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- R&amp;D Mag, 2016/12/21</span>

                    After decades of eluding researchers because of chemical instability, key metal-oxide clusters have been isolated in water, a significant advance for growing the clusters with the impeccable control over atoms that&#x27;s required to manufacture small features in electronic circuits. Oregon State University chemists created the aqueous cluster formation process. It yielded a polyoxocation of zinc, aluminum and chromium that is not protected by the organic ligand shell that is usually required to capture such molecules from water. &quot;Our discovery is exciting in that it provides both new fundamental understanding and new materials, and useful applications are always built on a foundation of fundamental understanding,&quot; said May Nyman, a professor of chemistry at Oregon State. Metal oxides - compounds produced when metals combine with oxygen - serve a variety of important purposes. For example, titanium dioxide is a catalyst that degrades pollutants, and aluminum oxides and iron oxides are coagulants used as the first step in purifying drinking water. &quot;Metal oxides influence processes everywhere,&quot; Nyman said. &quot;They control the spread of contaminants in the environment. They are the touchscreen of your cellphone. The metal-oxide cluster forms are in your body storing iron and in plants controlling photosynthesis. Most of these processes are in water. Yet scientists still know so little about how these metal oxides operate in nature, or how we can make them with the absolute control needed for high-performance materials in energy applications.&quot; <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- R&amp;D Mag, 2016/12/9</span>

                    Companies can now test self-driving cars on Michigan public roads without a driver or steering wheel under new laws that could push the state to the forefront of autonomous vehicle development. The package of bills signed into law Friday comes with few specific state regulations and leaves many decisions up to automakers and companies like Google and Uber. It also allows automakers and tech companies to run autonomous taxi services and permits test parades of self-driving tractor-trailers as long as humans are in each truck. And they allow the sale of self-driving vehicles to the public once they are tested and certified, according to the state. The bills allow testing without burdensome regulations so the industry can move forward with potential life-saving technology, said Gov. Rick Snyder, who was to sign the bills. &quot;It makes Michigan a place where particularly for the auto industry it&#x27;s a good place to do work,&quot; he said. The bills give Michigan the potential to be a leader by giving the companies more autonomy than say, California, which now requires human backup drivers in case something goes awry. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- Scientific Computing, 2016/12/19</span>

                  <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
                    In science, sometimes the best discoveries come when you&#x27;re exploring something else entirely. That&#x27;s the case with recent findings from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), where a research team has come up with a way to build safe, nontoxic gold wires onto flexible, thin plastic film. Their demonstration potentially clears the path for a host of wearable electronic devices that monitor our health. The finding might overcome a basic issue confronting medical engineers: How to create electronics that are flexible enough to be worn comfortably on or even inside the human body--without exposing a person to harmful chemicals in the process--and will last long enough to be useful and convenient. &quot;Overall this could be a major step in wearable sensor research,&quot; said NIST biomedical engineer Darwin Reyes-Hernandez. Wearable health monitors are already commonplace; bracelet-style fitness trackers have escaped mere utility to become a full-on fashion trend. But the medical field has its eye on something more profound, known as personalized medicine. The long-term goal is to keep track of hundreds of real-time changes in our bodies--from fluctuations in the amount of potassium in sweat to the level of particular sugars or proteins in the bloodstream. These changes manifest themselves a bit differently in each person, and some of them could mark the onset of disease in ways not yet apparent to a doctor&#x27;s eye. Wearable electronics might help spot those problems early. First, though, engineers need a way to build them so that they work dependably and safely--a tall order for the metals that make up their circuits and the flexible surfaces or &quot;substrates&quot; on which they are built. Gold is a good option because it does not corrode, unlike most metals, and it has the added value of being nontoxic. But it&#x27;s also brittle. If you bend it, it tends to crack, potentially breaking completely-- meaning thin gold wires might stop conducting electricity after a few twists of the body. &quot;Gold has been used to make wires that run across plastic surfaces, but until now the plastic has needed to be fairly rigid,&quot; said Reyes-Hernandez. &quot;You wouldn&#x27;t want it attached to you; it would be uncomfortable.&quot; Reyes-Hernandez doesn&#x27;t work on wearable electronics. His field is microfluidics, the study of tiny quantities of liquid and their flow, typically through narrow, thin channels. One day he was exploring a commercially available porous polyester membrane--it feels like ordinary plastic wrap, only a lot lighter and thinner--to see if its tiny holes could make it useful for separating different fluid components. He patterned some gold electrodes onto the membrane to create a simple device that would help with separations. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- Scientific Computing, 2016/12/12</span>

                    Piezoelectric sensors measure changes in pressure, acceleration, temperature, strain or force and are used in a vast array of devices important to everyday life. However, these sensors often can be limited by the &quot;white noise&quot; they detect that can give engineers and health care workers false readings. Now, a University of Missouri College of Engineering research team has developed methods to enhance piezoelectric sensing capabilities. Enhanced sensors could be used to improve aviation, detect structural damage in buildings and bridges, and boost the capabilities of health monitors. Guoliang Huang, an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering in the MU College of Engineering, and his team&#x27;s new platform improves sensors by amplifying the signal, allowing the same amount of sensors to read more data. Their new device also cuts costs by allowing fewer sensors to cover larger structures and longer distances. &quot;In the past, methods to produce signal intensification only have included electrical amplification,&quot; Huang said. &quot;Our technique uses a combination of mechanical and electrical amplification, overcoming the limitations of using just electrical amplification.&quot; The new sensing platform can be &quot;tuned&quot; using an electric signal, which when connected to circuit boards with sensors can pick up weaker signals that previously could not be detected. &quot;The amplified wave cuts through the surrounding noise,&quot; Huang said. &quot;It&#x27;s the first such device that illustrates how to use adaptive metamaterials to improve elastic wave sensing capabilities. This can be very useful to developing high-sensitivity sensing technology.&quot; <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- Scientific Computing, 2016/12/12</span>

                    To the list of cool new things made in Silicon Valley, add this: Life, improved. Inside “clean rooms” of Stanford University’s fledgling Laboratory for Cell and Gene Medicine, lab techs tend machines that churn out gene-engineered cells, which can attack cancer, fix blood disease, patch a heart, alter the immune system, build skin grafts and create a realm of yet-to-be discovered therapies. The 25,000-square-foot facility, which opened last September, puts Stanford at the forefront of one of medicine’s most important and promising trends: regenerative medicine, which aims to refurbish diseased or damaged tissue using the body’s own healthy cells. “We’re curing the incurable,” said laboratory director David DiGiusto, who holds a doctorate. Critics complain that no one makes anything in Silicon Valley anymore except mobile apps and plug-in cars, a decades-long gripe that dates back to the shuttering of chip fabrication plants. But inside this California Avenue building — constructed with the university’s trademark sandstone-colored stucco, columns, arches and red-tiled roof — is the future of precise, sterile, multistepped and highly automated biological manufacturing. One of its most successful products is genetically corrected skin, produced in small sheets and grafted onto patients with the blistering skin disease epidermolysis bullosa. People with this excruciating disease have a defective gene that prevents normal production of a protein called type-7 collagen, so their layers of skin do not adhere properly. To fix this, Stanford researchers use a virus to deliver a correct version of the gene onto batches of skin cells, then coax them to form sheets of healthy skin. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- Stanford News, 2016/12/18</span>

                    A new bioinformatics platform called Empowering the Development of Genomics Expertise (EDGE) will help democratize the genomics revolution by allowing users with limited bioinformatics expertise to quickly analyze and interpret genomic sequence data. Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory and their collaborators at the Naval Medical Research Center developed EDGE, which is described in a paper recently published in Nucleic Acids Research. “We realized that while next-generation sequencing instruments are becoming more widespread and more accessible to the average biologist or physician, the bioinformatics tools required to process and analyze the data were not as user-friendly or accessible,” said Patrick Chain, of Los Alamos’ Biosecurity and Public Health group and EDGE team lead. “Given the large number of applications where sequencing is now used, a robust bioinformatics platform that encapsulates a broad array of algorithms is required to help address questions a researcher may have. We sought to develop a web-based environment where non-bioinformatics experts could easily select what pipelines they need and rapidly obtain results and interact with their data.” Stopping the spread of disease—from naturally occurring or manmade threats—requires an in-depth understanding of pathogens and how they work. To this end, the ability to characterize organisms through accurately and rapidly comparing genomic data is an important part of Los Alamos’ national security mission. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- Scientific Computing, 2016/12/19</span>

                    Single-stranded, noncoding micro-ribonucleic acids (microRNAs), consisting of 18-23 nucleotides, play a key role in regulating gene expression. Levels of microRNAs circulating within blood can be correlated to different states of diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders and cardiovascular conditions. Many microRNAs within the blood are encapsulated within exosomes, nanoscale vesicles released by the cells. Accurate measurement of the quantity of microRNAs circulating within the blood is extremely challenging because of their short lengths, similar sequences and low concentration levels. Due to their small number of nucleotides, traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection methods must necessarily involve a ligation, or linking, step to produce longer complementary DNA strands. Such ligation often produces large biases. Consequently, large volumes of clinical samples typically required to obtain accurate measurements, but few conventional detection systems can handle this directly without proper sample preparation and volume reduction. A team of researchers in Italy from the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia and the University of Naples Federico II, both in Naples, set out to develop a simple, ultrasensitive fluorescence detection system of in-flow microRNAs that uses spectrally encoded microgels. As the team reports in Biomicrofluidics, from AIP Publishing, until now such a multiplexed barcode detection approach has only been performed in time-consuming observation procedures, significantly hindering its possible diagnostic performance. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- R&amp;D Mag, 2016/12/19</span>

                    What can&#x27;t graphene do? You can scratch &quot;detect cancer&quot; off of that list. By interfacing brain cells onto graphene, researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago have shown they can differentiate a single hyperactive cancerous cell from a normal cell, pointing the way to developing a simple, noninvasive tool for early cancer diagnosis. &quot;This graphene system is able to detect the level of activity of an interfaced cell,&quot; says Vikas Berry, associate professor and head of chemical engineering at UIC, who led the research along with Ankit Mehta, assistant professor of clinical neurosurgery in the UIC College of Medicine. &quot;Graphene is the thinnest known material and is very sensitive to whatever happens on its surface,&quot; Berry said. The nanomaterial is composed of a single layer of carbon atoms linked in a hexagonal chicken-wire pattern, and all the atoms share a cloud of electrons moving freely about the surface. &quot;The cell&#x27;s interface with graphene rearranges the charge distribution in graphene, which modifies the energy of atomic vibration as detected by Raman spectroscopy,&quot; Berry said, referring to a powerful workhorse technique that is routinely used to study graphene. The atomic vibration energy in graphene&#x27;s crystal lattice differs depending on whether it&#x27;s in contact with a cancer cell or a normal cell, Berry said, because the cancer cell&#x27;s hyperactivity leads to a higher negative charge on its surface and the release of more protons. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- R&amp;D Mag, 2016/12/20</span>

                    In their search for new ways to treat cancer, many scientists are using a high-tech process called genome sequencing to hunt for genetic mutations that encourage tumor cells to thrive. To aid in this search, some researchers have developed new bioinformatics methods that each claim to help pinpoint the cancer-friendly mutants. But a stubborn question remains: Among the numerous new tactics that aim to spotlight the so-called cancer driver genes, which produce the most accurate results? To help solve this puzzle, a team of Johns Hopkins University computational scientists and cancer experts have devised their own bioinformatics software to evaluate how well the current strategies identify cancer-promoting mutations and distinguish them from benign mutations in cancer cells. The team&#x27;s paper, titled &quot;Evaluating the evaluation of cancer driver genes,&quot; was published recently in the Early Edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The scholars say it is important to assess how well these genetic research methods work because of their potential value in developing treatments to keep cancer in check. &quot;Identifying the genes that cause cancer when altered is often challenging, but is critical for directing research along the most fruitful course,&quot; said Bert Vogelstein, a member of the Ludwig Center at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center and one of the journal article&#x27;s co-authors. &quot;This paper establishes novel ways to judge the techniques used to identify true cancer-causing genes and should considerably facilitate advances in this field in the future.&quot; <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- Johns Hopkins University News, 2016/12/20</span>

                    Scientists from the Scripps Research Institute created an efficient screening process that can quickly find new “enediyne natural products,” which are essentially promising drug leads derived from soil microbes. The team, led by TSRI professor Ben Shen, Ph.D., used this technique to identify a new group of enediyne natural products named tiancimycins. These products can kill certain cancer cells more quickly and completely than the monoclonal antibodies used in conjunction with cytotoxic drugs that target only cancer cells, according to the official announcement. &quot;The enediynes represent one of the most fascinating families of natural products for their extraordinary biological activities,&quot; said Shen in a statement. &quot;By surveying 3,400 strains from the TSRI collection, we were able to identify 81 strains that harbor genes encoding enediynes. With what we know, we can predict novel structural insights that can be exploited to radically accelerate enediyne-based drug discovery and development.&quot; Essentially, Shen’s method involved prioritizing the microbial strains that could produce the most important natural compounds enabling a more efficient allocation of resources during the discovery process.  Other researchers have used similar methods to sift through large amounts of data in order to pinpoint promising compounds to treat diseases. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- R&amp;D Mag, 2016/12/21</span>

                    Before modern medical lab techniques became available, doctors diagnosed some diseases by smelling a patient&#x27;s breath. Scientists have been working for years to develop analytical instruments that can mimic this sniff-and-diagnose ability. Now, researchers report in the journal ACS Nano that they have identified a unique &quot;breathprint&quot; for each disease. Using this information, they have designed a device that screens breath samples to classify and diagnose several types of diseases. Exhaled breath contains nitrogen, carbon dioxide and oxygen, as well as a small amount of more than 100 other volatile chemical components. The relative amounts of these substances vary depending on the state of a person&#x27;s health. As far back as around 400 B.C., Hippocrates told his students to &quot;smell your patients&#x27; breath&quot; to search for clues of diseases such as diabetes (which creates a sweet smell). In more recent times, several teams of scientists have developed experimental breath analyzers, but most of these instruments focus on a single type of disease, such as cancer. In their own work, Hossam Haick and a team of collaborators in 14 clinical departments worldwide wanted to create a breathalyzer that could distinguish among multiple diseases. The researchers developed an array of nanoscale sensors to detect the individual components in thousands of breath samples from patients who were either healthy or had one of 17 different diseases, such as kidney cancer or Parkinson&#x27;s disease. By analyzing the results with artificial intelligence techniques, the team could use the array to classify and diagnose the conditions. The team used mass spectrometry to identify the breath components associated with the diseases. They found that each disease produces a unique volatile chemical breathprint, based on differing amounts of 13 components. They also showed that the presence of one disease would not prevent the detection of others - a prerequisite for developing a practical device to screen and diagnose various diseases in a noninvasive, inexpensive and portable manner. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- R&amp;D Mag, 2016/12/21</span>

                    Black light does more than make posters glow. Cornell researchers have developed a chemical tool to control inflammation that is activated by ultraviolet (UV) light. The method will allow scientists to study inflammation and the immune system, and may one day prove effective as a targeted therapy for inflammatory diseases, while minimizing side effects to healthy tissues. The researchers, who reported their results in a study published in October in the journal Chemical Science, designed a small molecule that is capable of controlling an immune response when exposed to UV light radiation. &quot;Currently, there aren&#x27;t a lot of tools that are able to manipulate the immune system in a spatio-temporal fashion,&quot; said Pamela Chang, assistant professor of microbiology and immunology, and the paper&#x27;s senior author. Bibudha Parasar, a graduate student in Chang&#x27;s lab, is the paper&#x27;s first author. &quot;We are pushing the forefront of developing new technologies to control inflammation and the immune system, with the ultimate goal of being able to study these biological pathways and perhaps develop therapies for inflammatory diseases,&quot; Chang said. Inflammation is caused by the immune system as one of the body&#x27;s responses to eliminate infectious pathogens and other foreign or dangerous agents. When inflammation becomes chronic, it can lead to a host of diseases, including asthma, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease. The researchers created a chemical probe that inhibits a reaction mediated by enzymes called histone deacetylases (HDACs). These enzymes regulate genes that turn on when the immune system is challenged and promote inflammation. HDACs also have inhibitors that suppress this inflammatory response, and the probe specifically activates these inhibitors but only in the presence of UV light. This is especially useful since HDACs are ubiquitous and have other biological effects, and most drugs affect the entire system, leading to unintended consequences. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- R&amp;D Mag, 2016/12/6</span>

            <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
              Bill Gates has announced a $1 billion investment fund to back radical approaches to clean energy. Last year, Gates established the Breakthrough Energy Coalition with more than 20 billionaires, among them Amazon&#x27;s Jeff Bezos, Alibaba&#x27;s Jack Ma, and Virgin&#x27;s Richard Branson. At the time, they promised to invest at least $2 billion into new technologies. The Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund is the first wave of that investment. Established to take a long-term approach to funding energy ideas, it will help startups considered to be too risky by regular venture capital firms. In a statement announcing the launch of the fund, John Arnold, who is one of the billionaire investors, explained that the &quot;dearth of venture funding for clean energy technologies threatens to create a valley of death for the industry, with emerging ideas unable to find the necessary capital to reach commercialization.&quot; The new fund plans to step in and bridge that gap. Its investments, which will take place over the next 20 years, won’t be limited to electricity production—they’ll also include new technologies for transportation, agriculture, manufacturing, and construction. It will fund projects that promise the biggest possible benefit to the planet’s future climate, as long as the science underlying the application has been proved in the lab and can plausibly be scaled up. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- MIT Tech Review, 2016/12/12</span>

              Boeing has begun final assembly of the 787-10 Dreamliner, the latest and biggest member in the Boeing 787 family of commercial aircraft. Two major fuselage sections for the aircraft have been moved to North Charleston, S.C. The third section, the forward fuselage, is being made at Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kan., and will be brought to North Charleston. Darrel Larson, the build integration leader for Boeing’s 787-10 program, said the development of the aircraft is a major milestone for Boeing and South Carolina.“This airplane will only be built here in North Charleston,” said Larson. “Pieces will continue to be built around the globe in our supply chain, but the 787-10 will only fly out of North Charleston.” According to a 2014 article from Materials Today, the 787 is the first major commercial airplane to have a composite fuselage, composite wings, and use composites in most other airframe components. A 2007 report from Toray notes that each 787 contains approximately 77,000 pounds of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), made with 23 tons of carbon fiber.

            <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
              Sebastian Thrun smiles a little awkwardly as he explains why he no longer believes in the educational revolution he sold to the world just a few years ago.
The lean, balding robotics pioneer has been instrumental in convincing investors, governments, and colleges to splurge millions on the online college education platforms dubbed MOOCs, or massive online open courses, billed as opening up quality education to anyone on Earth (see “The Crisis in Higher Education”). Thrun, a Stanford professor, helped birth the frenzy when he put his introductory artificial intelligence course online in 2011, accidentally attracting 160,000 students. Amazed by the response, he took time out from Stanford and also from a side job working on autonomous cars and other research at Google to found Udacity, a company offering MOOCs in computing, math, and physics. It attracted $160 million in venture capital investment and teamed up with San Jose State University to offer courses valid for college credit. But within two years of Udacity’s launch, Thrun began to question whether MOOCs could make much of a mark on the world in their current form. Udacity’s completion rates were as low as 2 percent, and the people who made it through were mostly the kind of well-motivated students already served well by conventional institutions. Meanwhile, it was clear that many people sought out MOOCs to improve their employment prospects, but providers seemed more focused on emulating colleges than serving that need. Thrun, now Udacity’s president, didn’t waste much time turning the company away from its founding ideas to market itself as a gateway to a new job in the tech industry. The company partners with employers such as Amazon and Facebook to offer “nanodegrees” that are tightly vocational. “We are happy we moved out of the MOOC space,” he says. “We are able to outpace universities with curricula that you wouldn&#x27;t find in any university, that empower students to find jobs.” <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- MIT Tech Review, 2016/12/14</span>

            <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
              Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has created a pavilion installation, known as Flotsam &amp; Jetsam, which is now one of the world’s largest 3D printed objects. The installations were commissioned by New York-based architecture firm SHoP Architects, and created by ORNL, Techmer ES and Branch Technology. They were printed using two different types of composites. The pavilions’ canopies utilized custom carbon fiber-reinforced acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) composite materials, which were developed by Techmer ES. The printing itself was done by Branch Technology, which used its free-form cellular fabrication technique. The pavilions’ seating and counter space were printed with Techmer’s bio-based PLA compound that is reinforced with bamboo fibers. These fibers were printed in DOE’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility located at ORNL using a Cincinnati Incorporated’s Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM) machine. Over the past few years, BAAM has been used for ORNL’s record-breaking 3-D printed item, as well as Local Motors’ 3-D printed car and a replica of the Shelby Mustang, among others. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- Composites Manufacturing, 2016/12/14</span>

            <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
              Wabash National Corp. (Lafayette, Ind.) says it received a commitment from a fourth fleet to join the company’s launch program for its Cold Chain Series refrigerated van trailer made with molded structural composites, which is reportedly the first trailer of its kind. Wabash National’s Cold Chain Series refrigerated van is made out of the company’s proprietary molded structural composite with thermal technology (MSCT), which improves thermal performance by up to 25% and is up to 20% lighter, while significantly improving puncture and damage resistance. In addition, the molded structural composite floor system promises higher floor ratings—up to 24,000 pounds. Leonard’s Express joins Werner Enterprises, K&amp;B Transportation and Combined Transport—with dealers Regional International, TEC Equipment and Wick’s Truck Trailers—to bring the company’s refrigerated trailer to the North American market. “The launch program for our Cold Chain Series composite reefer continues to move forward as planned,” says Brent Yeagy, president and chief operating officer. “Refrigerated carriers see the superior performance benefits in our new molded structural composite technology. Many carriers have been very interested in participating in the launch program so they can better understand the value of the performance benefits on their operations.” <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- CompositesWorld, 2016/12/15</span>

            <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
              BlackBerry Ltd. boosted its fiscal 2017 earnings outlook and posted a profit in the third quarter, showing that the company’s bet on moving more into software and completely away from handsets is paying off. Fiscal third-quarter earnings per share, excluding some items, were 2 cents, compared with analysts’ average estimate of a loss of 1 cent. BlackBerry said it now expects to post a profit for the full year, up from a prior range of breakeven to a five-cent loss, according to a statement Tuesday. Shares rose as much as 4.4%, the biggest intraday gain in two months. They were up 3.6% to $7.99 at 9:47 a.m. in New York. Total revenue was down and missed estimates, but the profit numbers and forecast show BlackBerry’s transition to a higher-margin software company from an ailing smartphone maker is hitting CEO John Chen’s targets. The adjusted profit margin was almost 70% of revenue, its highest ever. BlackBerry now gets more than half of total revenue from its collection of software products, which include operating systems for car entertainment systems, secure file sharing software and programs to help companies keep track of their mobile devices. Last week, Chen announced a deal with TCL Corp. to license its brand to the Chinese manufacturer, effectively outsourcing the rights to design, produce and distribute BlackBerry devices around the world. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- IndustryWeek, 2016/12/20</span>

            <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
              Honda Motor Co. is talking to Waymo, the autonomous driving unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc., to try to strike a deal that would put its self-driving technology into some of the Japanese automaker’s cars. Both companies stressed that the talks are about research, rather than full production vehicles, at least at this point. If all goes well, Honda may provide Waymo with vehicles that are modified to run the self-driving system, and those cars would join the existing Waymo fleet currently being tested in four U.S. cities. (In addition to Mountain View, California, where the tech has been road-tested since 2009, Waymo is now testing in Austin, Texas; Kirkland, Washington; and Phoenix, Arizona.) Discussions with Honda underscore that Waymo wants to develop the brains behind self-driving vehicle technology rather than build the cars that use it. The talks also show that Waymo, the new name of Google’s Self-Driving Car Project, is eager to work with more car companies as it races to rack up test miles with its autonomous-drive systems and prepare it for commercialization. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- IndustryWeek, 2016/12/22</span>

              A few days of regulatory tussles were enough for Uber Technologies Inc. to pull its fleet of self-driving cars from the streets of San Francisco and send them instead to friendlier territory in Arizona. The California Department of Motor Vehicles banned Uber’s self-driving cars from San Francisco on Wednesday, just days after they first deployed. In response, Uber picked up and moved out.“Our cars departed for Arizona this morning by truck,” Uber said Thursday in an e-mail. “We’ll be expanding our self-driving pilot there in the next few weeks, and we’re excited to have the support of Governor (Doug) Ducey.” Ducey wooed Uber on social media Wednesday evening, when the ride-hailing company pulled its self-driving test from San Francisco. “California may not want you; but AZ does!” he wrote on Twitter. The next morning, Uber’s fleet was headed his way. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- IndustryWeek, 2016/12/22</span>

            <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
              One of the more fantastical aspects of 3D printing, besides the ability to see your digital sketch become a physical object in front of your eyes, is that it can be done almost anywhere. As long as you have a printer, a power hookup, and plenty of raw material, your office, desk, or garage can become a small factory. The technology’s promise of decentralizing production suggests that companies betting on the future of additive manufacturing can spring up anywhere with creativity, capital, and drive. And while industrial-capability 3D printing is still in development, this cutting-edge technology has already resulted in clusters of like-minded companies and centers of innovation. And one of the most bustling areas for additive manufacturing in the country, and perhaps the world, may just be eastern Tennessee. Knoxville, Tennessee, first settled in 1786, may seem unlikely as a center for next-generation technology for those unfamiliar with the region. But its emergence is payoff for generations of government investment in research and development. Pioneering research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory—a facility founded in the 1940s as part of the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb—as well as government support of advanced manufacturing, has created a magnet that has lured innovative manufacturing companies. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- CompositesWorld, 2016/12/8</span>

            <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
              U.S. manufacturers recognize the potential of the digital technologies known collectively as Industry 4.0 to create value, but they are largely approaching the opportunity in piecemeal fashion and may miss out on the significant business benefits these technologies offer, according to new research from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Nearly 90% of manufacturing leaders surveyed by BCG regarded adopting Industry 4.0 technologies as a way to improve productivity, but only about one in four see opportunities to use these advances to build new revenue streams. Many are pursuing isolated initiatives scattered throughout the company, BCG found in its new report, &quot;Sprinting to Value in Industry 4.0,&quot; without a clear vision and coordination from the top. The stakes are high, BCG stresses, as the value created by Industry 4.0 vastly exceeds the low-single-digit cost savings that many manufacturers are currently pursuing. “In an era of stagnating productivity, Industry 4.0 stands out as a means of generating significant productivity gains,” says Justin Rose, a BCG partner and a coauthor of the report. “The real value is achieved when manufacturers maximize the impact of these advances by combining them in a comprehensive program.” To succeed, companies must set ambitious goals and capture value rapidly over the course of a multiyear transformation. “Our findings point to the need for U.S. manufacturers to gain a deeper understanding of how they can apply Industry 4.0 and accelerate the pace of adoption,” says Vlad Lukic, a BCG partner and report coauthor. “The winners will approach the race to Industry 4.0 as a series of sprints but manage their program as a marathon.” To gain insights about the status of Industry 4.0 adoption by US manufacturers and the challenges they face, BCG surveyed 380 US-based manufacturing executives and managers at companies representing a wide range of sizes in various industries. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- IndustryWeek, 2016/12/8</span>

            <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
              Foster Corp., a leader in polymer solutions for healthcare markets, introduces Nanomed MAX compounds for medical device components that require high strength, yet cannot use metals or traditional reinforced plastics. These compounds, based on an alloy of meta-xylene diamine polyamide (MX nylon), are United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Class VI tested and suitable for reusable instruments or components that must withstand gamma, e-beam and ethylene oxide sterilization. Minimally invasive procedures are increasingly used throughout the healthcare industry. New procedures require instruments, fixtures and components that do not interfere with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized axial tomography (CAT), fluoroscopy, and x-ray imaging. Metals are not suitable and plastics often require reinforcing additives, such as glass fiber, to provide sufficient strength for structural components. However, these traditional additives are too large for molding or extruding intricate device components with thin wall sections. Unreinforced, high strength plastic options, such as polyetheretherketone (PEEK), are often cost prohibitive. Nanomed MAX compounds incorporate nanoclay particles into a high strength nylon alloy. These platelet-shaped particles, less than a nanometer thick and up to 1000 times greater in surface diameter, provide reinforcement at the molecular level. This enhances strength and rigidity of the polymer without hindering flow into thin sections. Nanomed MAX compounds include less than 10% by weight nanoparticles resulting in 15% more tensile strength than unmodified PEEK, for approximately half the price. <span class="source" style="color: gray; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;">-- CompositesWorld, 2016/12/9</span>
