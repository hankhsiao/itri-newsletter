The findings by Daniel Lum, a graduate student in physics, and John Howell, a professor of physics, have been published in the journal Physical Review A. &quot;Daniel's research amounts to an important step forward, not just for encryption, but for the field of quantum data locking,&quot; said Howell. Quantum data locking is a method of encryption advanced by Seth Lloyd, a professor of quantum information at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that uses photons—the smallest particles associated with light—to carry a message. Quantum data locking was thought to have limitations for securely encrypting messages, but Lloyd figured out how to make additional assumptions—namely those involving the boundary between light and matter—to make it a more secure method of sending data. While a binary system allows for only an on or off position with each bit of information, photon waves can be altered in many more ways: the angle of tilt can be changed, the wavelength can be made longer or shorter, and the size of the amplitude can be modified. Since a photon has more variables—and there are fundamental uncertainties when it comes to quantum measurements—the quantum key for encrypting and deciphering a message can be shorter that the message itself.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em> -- R&amp;D Mag, 9/07/2016</em></font></font></font><br>

      </font>
     <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> An initial version of the 5G specification for mobile applications could be agreed upon on by the end of 2017 but that doesn't mean the over-arching spec is agreed upon yet. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) 's NSA-NR (Non-Standalone-New Radio) specification is now due to be baked in December 2017. &quot;NSA-NR is intended for mobile devices,&quot; Qualcomm Inc. (Nasdaq: QCOM)'s SVP of engineering, Durga Malladi, told me on the show floor Wednesday evening. The non-standalone part of NSA-NR refers to the fact that a 5G radio is twinned with LTE as the &quot;anchor network&quot; managing the connection. In other words, 5G is the fast radio super highway, while LTE functions as the stop and go lights controlling the traffic and making sure calls get on and off the highway. (See Is This the 5G You're Looking For?) The NSA-NR specification is different from the initial fixed application that Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) says it wants to use its 5G specification for; the NSA-NR would target mobile use cases as well. Deploying 5G for mobile will be more difficult than fixed, since the devices must be smaller and the network will need to support fast hand-overs as people move between cell sites. If NSA-NR is baked in December that means that it is possible that initial mobile devices might start to arrive in late 2018 or early 2019. There is a significant milestone for the development of the 5G specification coming ahead of that in March 2017, notes Michael Murphy, Nokia Corp.  (NYSE: NOK)'s head of technology for North America, in a meeting Thursday morning. This is a checkpoint meeting by various working groups to ensure compatibility on the specification work so far. "Remember, there is no 3GPP standard yet, we'll have to wait and see," Murphy said. "The question is, will they hit their targets?" Murphy asked rhetorically. "There's a fairly good chance it will happen." </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>-- Light Reading, 9/08/2016</em></font></font></font><br>

    <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The U.S. Federal Communications Commission will vote September 29 on a proposal aimed to blast open competition in digital media. If approved the new rules are expected to ignite a firestorm of legal challenges, but experts say they enable limited abilities to create new kinds of TVs or set-top boxes. The proposal would require any provider of paid-for video services with more than 400,000 customers to make free apps available for every major digital media platform such as Android, iOS or Windows. It envisions a new industry standards body made up of studios and broadcasters that will set terms under which device makers can license the apps. The FCC will review license terms to make sure they support open competition. The apps are supposed to give device makers access to all the service provider’s video content. They aim to provide through metadata and an API whatever search and DVR-like control features the provider supports. The end goal is any third party device can supply the same experience the provider gives its customers through their proprietary, leased set-top boxes. The proposal marks a significant and more detailed revision of a plan the FCC announced in February. The original plan would have required content providers to adopt open standards so that any device maker could access their video and data streams and thus build systems competing with leased set-tops. Cable-TV and other vendors came out strongly against the original proposal, saying it would undermine existing deals with studios and other content providers. The FCC says the new plan lets video providers control content through the app in a way which respects existing deals with studios. Comcast, the largest U.S. cable-TV provider, quickly came out against the new FCC proposal. A spokesman for the company, which includes a major studio, said the new proposal imposes “an overly complicated government licensing regime and heavy-handed regulation in a fast-moving technological space.” </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>-- EE Times, 9/09/2016</em></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It does not take an infinite number of monkeys to type a passage of Shakespeare. Instead, it takes a single monkey equipped with brain-sensing technology – and a cheat sheet. That technology, developed by Stanford Bio-X scientists Krishna Shenoy, a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford, and postdoctoral fellow Paul Nuyujukian, directly reads brain signals to drive a cursor moving over a keyboard. In an experiment conducted with monkeys, the animals were able to transcribe passages from the New York Times and Hamlet at a rate of up to 12 words per minute. Earlier versions of the technology have already been tested successfully in people with paralysis, but the typing was slow and imprecise. This latest work tests improvements to the speed and accuracy of the technology that interprets brain signals and drives the cursor. “Our results demonstrate that this interface may have great promise for use in people,” said Nuyujukian, who will join Stanford faculty as an assistant professor of bioengineering in 2017. “It enables a typing rate sufficient for a meaningful conversation.” <strong>Communication challenges: </strong>Other approaches for helping people with movement disabilities type involve tracking eye movements or, as in the case of Stephen Hawking, tracking movements of individual muscles in the face. However, these have limitations, and can require a degree of muscle control that might be difficult for some people. For example, Hawking wasn’t able to use eye-tracking software due to drooping eyelids and other people find eye-tracking technology tiring.</font>  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>-- Stanford News, 9/12/2016</em></font></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In today’s computer chips, memory management is based on what computer scientists call the principle of locality: If a program needs a chunk of data stored at some memory location, it probably needs the neighboring chunks as well. But that assumption breaks down in the age of big data, now that computer programs more frequently act on just a few data items scattered arbitrarily across huge data sets. Since fetching data from their main memory banks is the major performance bottleneck in today’s chips, having to fetch it more frequently can dramatically slow program execution. This week, at the International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques, researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) are presenting a new programming language, called Milk, that lets application developers manage memory more efficiently in programs that deal with scattered data points in large data sets. In tests on several common algorithms, programs written in the new language were four times as fast as those written in existing languages. But the researchers believe that further work will yield even larger gains. The reason that today’s big data sets pose problems for existing memory management techniques, explains Saman Amarasinghe, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science, is not so much that they are large as that they are what computer scientists call “sparse.” That is, with big data, the scale of the solution does not necessarily increase proportionally with the scale of the problem. “In social settings, we used to look at smaller problems,” Amarasinghe says. “If you look at the people in this [CSAIL] building, we’re all connected. But if you look at the planet scale, I don’t scale my number of friends. The planet has billions of people, but I still have only hundreds of friends. Suddenly you have a very sparse problem.” Similarly, Amarasinghe says, an online bookseller with, say, 1,000 customers might like to provide its visitors with a list of its 20 most popular books. It doesn’t follow, however, that an online bookseller with a million customers would want to provide its visitors with a list of its 20,000 most popular books.   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>-- MIT News, 9/13/2016</em></font></font><br>

    <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stanford engineers have invented a technology that would allow an internet user to tell network providers and online publishers when and if they want content or services to be given preferential delivery, an advance that could transform the network neutrality debate. Net neutrality, as it’s often called, is the proposition that internet providers should allow equal access to all content rather than give certain applications favored status or block others. On home networks, favored status is known as fast track delivery. On mobile devices the terminology is zero-rating, because favored traffic does not count against data usage caps. For years, the net neutrality debate has been at an impasse: either the internet is open or preferences are allowed. But the Stanford engineers – Professor Nick McKeown, Associate Professor Sachin Katti and electrical engineering PhD Yiannis Yiakoumis -– say their new technology, called Network Cookies, makes it possible to have preferential delivery and an open internet. Network Cookies allow users to choose which home or mobile traffic should get favored delivery, while putting network operators and content providers on a level playing field in catering to such user-signaled preferences. “So far, net neutrality has been promoted as the best possible defense for users,” Katti said. “But treating all traffic the same isn’t necessarily the best way to protect users. It often restricts their options and this is why so-called exceptions from neutrality often come up. We think the best way to ensure that ISPs and content providers don’t make decisions that conflict with the interests of users is to let users decide how to configure their own traffic.” McKeown said Network Cookies implement user-directed preferences in ways that are consistent with the principles of net neutrality.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>-- Stanford News, 9/13/2016</em></font></font><br>

    <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The MIPI Alliance has started work on a standard interface for touch screens using its emerging I3C interconnect announced earlier this year. MIPI Touch, described at a developer’s conference here, aims to simplify work for engineers who currently support a handful of proprietary approaches. The interface includes a standard command set for relaying messages between the application processor and other touch components. It aims to replace a variety of approaches using I2C and SPI links the group claims are not well optimized for mobile systems The spec, now in a draft to contributors, is expected to be ratified sometime next year. It is being developed by companies including Intel, NXP, Qualcomm, Samsung and Synaptics. It’s not clear if potential users such as Apple and their vendors will support the effort. In the iPhone 6, Apple used a touchscreen controller from Broadcom and a line driver from Texas Instruments, according to a teardown by TechInsights. Apple is a contributing member of MIPI, but Broadcom is not a member. Today’s many touch-based smartphones, tablets and in-car gadgets send data “over a slow interface with customized register sets and functions so every OEM writes special drivers…MIPI Touch makes the process more transparent,” said Dale Stolitzka, a principal engineer in Samsung Display and chair of the MIPI Alliance’s display working group. MIPI Touch is not specific to today's mainstream capacitive touch sensors. It will support single-, multi-touch and stylus inputs; and it allows vendors to create custom commands and functions outside a basic shared command set. The current version of the spec does not take into account force data, also known as haptics, but the spec could be updated in the future to include it. Earlier this month , Apple described a large custom haptics sensor it built into its iPhone 7. Engineers may be able to implement MIPI Touch in firmware if their devices have an embedded controller, Stolitzka said. The MIPI I3C interface the touch standard is based on is in a final review stage now. I3C supports data rates of more than 30 Mbits/second and has compatibility modes for working with I2C. </font>  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>-- EE Times, 9/14/2016</em></font></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As many a relationship book can tell you, understanding someone else’s emotions can be a difficult task. Facial expressions aren’t always reliable: A smile can conceal frustration, while a poker face might mask a winning hand. But what if technology could tell us how someone is really feeling? Researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed “EQ-Radio,” a device that can detect a person’s emotions using wireless signals. By measuring subtle changes in breathing and heart rhythms, EQ-Radio is 87 percent accurate at detecting if a person is excited, happy, angry or sad — and can do so without on-body sensors. MIT professor and project lead Dina Katabi envisions the system being used in entertainment, consumer behavior, and health care. Film studios and ad agencies could test viewers’ reactions in real-time, while smart homes could use information about your mood to adjust the heating or suggest that you get some fresh air. “Our work shows that wireless signals can capture information about human behavior that is not always visible to the naked eye,” says Katabi, who co-wrote a paper on the topic with PhD students Mingmin Zhao and Fadel Adib. “We believe that our results could pave the way for future technologies that could help monitor and diagnose conditions like depression and anxiety.” EQ-Radio builds on Katabi’s continued efforts to use wireless technology for measuring human behaviors such as breathing and falling.

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though scientists have long known that mice can pick out scents — the smell of food, say, or the odor of a predator — they have been at a loss to explain how they are able to perform that seemingly complex task so easily. But a new study, led by Venkatesh Murthy, professor of molecular and cellular biology, suggests that the means of processing smells may be far simpler than researchers realized. Using a machine-learning algorithm, Murthy and colleagues were able to “train” a computer to recognize the neural patterns associated with various scents, and to identify whether specific odors were present in a mix of smells. The study is described in a Sept. 1 paper in the journal Neuron. Along with Murthy, the paper was co-authored by Alexander Mathis, Dan Rokni, and Vikrant Kapoor, postdoctoral fellows working in Murthy’s lab, and Professor Matthias Bethge from the Werner Reichardt Centre for Integrative Neuroscience &amp; Institute of Theoretical Physics in Germany. “It’s easy to identify the smell of coffee on its own. But if the smell of cinnamon and flowers is mixed in, can I still identify the coffee?” Murthy said. “In an earlier study, we tested that in mice, and found they can do it very well. “With this study, [we wanted to test] if we could build an algorithm … to do this in a computer, and what surprised us was how easy it is,” he said. “Initially, we thought it would be very complicated, but if you lay it out like a logic problem, it’s basically picking out a specific neural activation pattern that’s buried in a mix of patterns, and from a computer science perspective that’s do-able. The problem could be solved with a very simple linear classifier. It didn’t need the complexity and non-linearity that is built into deep neural networks. It’s no wonder mice were able to learn it so quickly and do it so well.” Essentially, Murthy said, the algorithm works like any other pattern-recognition system, only the patterns are the neural activation patterns of mice reacting to particular odors. “Essentially, one odor causes a particular neural activation pattern, and another odor causes a different pattern,” he said. “When you start mixing odors, eventually those patterns will overlap. Mice have about 1,000 types of olfactory receptors, but a given odor only activates maybe 10 percent of them. That’s sparse enough that, even if you have many scents mixed, they can still parse them out. What the algorithm does is look at those patterns, and even if they are partly occluded (by another odor), it can recognize that a particular pattern is there.” To “train” the algorithm to recognize those patterns, Murthy and colleagues gathered data on the neural activation patterns associated with various odors by imaging the brains of mice over thousands of trials. The team then used 80 percent of that data to train the system to recognize patterns of activation for particular odors, even when those patterns were masked by a mixture of other scents. <span class="style57"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/23/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></span><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you follow discussions about the Internet of Things, you’ve probably heard this stunning prediction at least once: The world will have 50 billion Internet-connected devices by 2020. Ericsson’s former CEO, Hans Vestburg, was among the first to toss out that number, when he gave a 2010 presentation to shareholders. The following year, Dave Evans, who worked for Cisco at the time, published the same prediction in a white paper. Today, that figure has arguably done more than any other statistic to set sky-high expectations for potential IoT growth and profits. Remarkably, those projections weren’t even close to the highest at that time. A 2012 IBM forecast predicted 1 trillion connected devices by 2015. “The numbers were getting kind of crazy,” recalls Bill Morelli, director of the IHS Markit division that handles IoT and digital security. Both Ericsson and Evans have since lowered their expectations for 2020: Evans, a cofounder of Stringify, who now serves as its chief technology officer, says he expects to see 30 billion connected devices by then; Ericsson figures on 28 billion by 2021. Other firms have adopted similar tones: IHS Markit projects 30.7 billion IoT devices for 2020; Gartner expects 20.8 billion by that time (excluding smartphones, tablets, and computers); and International Data Corp. anticipates 28.1 billion (again, not counting those devices). That’s likely because it’s the third quarter of 2016, and we’re nowhere near 1 trillion IoT devices—or even 50 billion for that matter. The true total is somewhere between Gartner’s estimate of 6.4 billion (excluding smartphones, tablets, and computers), and IHS Markit’s estimate of 17.6 billion (with all such devices included). But the popular 50 billion figure continues to be widely cited. Even Evans is a bit surprised by its staying power. “I think people do tend to latch onto numbers that seem really hard to fathom,” he says. “Fifty billion is pretty staggering.”</font> <span class="style57"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- IEEE Spectrum, 9/23/2016</em></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When it comes to policing artificial intelligence, technology leaders think there is safety in numbers. A new organization called the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society will seek to foster public dialogue and create guidelines for developing AI so that systems do not misbehave. The companies involved include Google and its subsidiary DeepMind, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM. The partnership is founded on eight tenets or principles, including the idea that AI should benefit as many people as possible; that the public should be involved in its development; that research should be conducted in an open way; and that AI systems should be able to explain their reasoning. That such fierce rivals would come together in this way shows how important the companies feel it is to head off public concern and speculation over the potential impacts of AI. These businesses are all reaping huge rewards from advances in AI, and they do not wish to see their industry subject to strict government regulation, which could slow or alter the technology’s progress at a critical moment in its evolution. But at the same time, rapid recent advances have raised concerns about the potential for AI systems to discriminate, disadvantage, and displace people. “We all share a duty to take the field forward in a thoughtful and positive and, importantly, ethical way,” says Mustafa Suleyman, cofounder of Google DeepMind and interim co-chair of the organization. “The positive impacts of AI will depend not only on the quality of our algorithms, but on the level of public engagement, of transparency, and ethical discussion that takes place around it.” AI is advancing at such a breakneck speed that there are legitimate concerns about it being deployed in ways that have unintended or unwanted effects. For instance, a machine-learning system designed to identify disease that is fed biased data might discriminate against certain people. The companies involved in the partnership recognize that a backlash could emerge in response to such effects. <span class="style57"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- Technology Review, 9/28/2016</em></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></font></span><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) has released the initial version of its Security Framework for industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) development. The Framework, an adjunct to the IIoT Reference Architecture the Consortium released last year, seeks to initiate a process that will result in broad industry consensus on how to secure IIoT systems. The goal is to ensure that security is a fundamental part of an IIoT system's architecture, not simply bolted on, and covers the system end-to-end including endpoint devices and the links between system elements. The IIC is an open membership organization, formed in 2014 to accelerate the development, adoption, and wide-spread use of interconnected machines and devices along with intelligent analytics. From its founding by AT&amp;T, Cisco, General Electric, IBM, and Intel, the Consortium has grown to more than 160 members from 24 countries and is now under management by the Object Management Group standards organization. &quot;The Security Framework looks at IIoT security from three different perspectives,&quot; Hamed Soroush, the IIC's security working group chair, told EE Times in an interview. &quot;Chip makers, equipment developers, and end users all have an important role in security for the IIoT, but often work without knowing one another's perspectives. The Framework will help them talk to each other.&quot; It also provides guidance to management on risk management when considering security, he added. Part of the motivation for creating the Framework is the difference between industrial IoT and consumer IoT security needs, Soroush noted, which calls for a discussion focused on industrial IoT system needs. Security in the industrial IoT should be more robust than for consumer IoT, for instance, to reduce the risks to critical infrastructure such as power generation. Also, unlike consumer systems, IIoT security needs to support decades long periods of deployment (which affects patch management), to preserve the integrity of high-availability systems, and to avoid conflicts with operational safety requirements.The Framework establishes a basis for discussions on how to address these needs. It also, Soroush pointed out, includes annexes that identify relevant existing security standards and best practices to guide developers. In addition, the Framework provides details on five characteristics — security, privacy, resilience, reliability and safety — that help define “trustworthiness” in the Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems that overlap in the IIoT, as well as defining risk, assessments, threats, metrics and performance indicators to help business management protect their organizations.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>-- EE Times, 9/29/2016</em></font></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sending a password or secret code over airborne radio waves like WiFi or Bluetooth means anyone can eavesdrop, making those transmissions vulnerable to hackers who can attempt to break the encrypted code. Now, University of Washington computer scientists and electrical engineers have devised a way to send secure passwords through the human body — using benign, low-frequency transmissions generated by fingerprint sensors and touchpads on consumer devices. “Fingerprint sensors have so far been used as an input device. What is cool is that we’ve shown for the first time that fingerprint sensors can be re-purposed to send out information that is confined to the body,” said senior author Shyam Gollakota, UW assistant professor of computer science and engineering. These “on-body” transmissions offer a more secure way to transmit authenticating information between devices that touch parts of your body — such as a smart door lock or wearable medical device — and a phone or device that confirms your identity by asking you to type in a password. This new technique, which leverages the signals already generated by fingerprint sensors on smartphones and laptop touchpads to transmit data in new ways, is described in apaper presented in September at the2016 Association for Computing Machinery’s International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp 2016) in Germany. “Let’s say I want to open a door using an electronic smart lock,” said co-lead author Merhdad Hessar, a UW electrical engineering doctoral student. “I can touch the doorknob and touch the fingerprint sensor on my phone and transmit my secret credentials through my body to open the door, without leaking that personal information over the air.” The research team tested the technique on iPhone and other fingerprint sensors, as well as Lenovo laptop trackpads and the Adafruit capacitive touchpad. In tests with 10 different subjects, they were able to generate usable on-body transmissions on people of different heights, weights and body types. The system also worked when subjects were in motion — including while they walked and moved their arms. “We showed that it works in different postures like standing, sitting and sleeping,” said co-lead author Vikram Iyer, a UW electrical engineering doctoral student. “We can also get a strong signal throughout your body. The receivers can be anywhere — on your leg, chest, hands — and still work.” The research team from the UW’sNetworks and Mobile Systems Labsystematically analyzed smartphone sensors to understand which of them generates low-frequency transmissions below 30 megahertz that travel well through the human body but don’t propagate over the air. <span class="style57"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>--R&amp;D Mag, 9/30/2016</em></font></font></span><br>

    <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial"> Rutgers University engineers have found a simple method for producing high-quality graphene that can be used in next-generation electronic and energy devices: bake the compound in a microwave oven. </font>The discovery is documented in a study published online today in the journal Science. &quot;This is a major advance in the graphene field,&quot; said Manish Chhowalla, professor and associate chair in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering in Rutgers' School of Engineering. &quot;This simple microwave treatment leads to exceptionally high quality graphene with properties approaching those in pristine graphene.&quot; The discovery was made by post-doctoral associates and undergraduate students in the department, said Chhowalla, who is also the director of the Rutgers Institute for Advanced Materials, Devices and Nanotechnology. Having undergraduates as co-authors of a Science paper is rare but he said &quot;the Rutgers Materials Science and Engineering Department and the School of Engineering at Rutgers cultivate a culture of curiosity driven research in students with fresh ideas who are not afraid to try something new.'' Graphene - 100 times tougher than steel - conducts electricity better than copper and rapidly dissipates heat, making it useful for many applications. Large-scale production of graphene is necessary for applications such as printable electronics, electrodes for batteries and catalysts for fuel cells. Graphene comes from graphite, a carbon-based material used by generations of students and teachers in the form of pencils. Graphite consists of sheets or layers of graphene. The easiest way to make large quantities of graphene is to exfoliate graphite into individual graphene sheets by using chemicals. The downside of this approach is that side reactions occur with oxygen - forming graphene oxide that is electrically non-conducting, which makes it less useful for products. Removing oxygen from graphene oxide to obtain high-quality graphene has been a major challenge over the past two decades for the scientific community working on graphene. Oxygen distorts the pristine atomic structure of graphene and degrades its properties.</font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/02/2016</em></font></font><br>

    <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial">Back in the 1990s, observers predicted that the single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) would be the nanomaterial that pushed silicon aside and created a post-CMOS world where Moore’s Law could continue its march towards ever=smaller chip dimensions. All of that hope was swallowed up by inconsistencies between semiconducting and metallic SWCNTs and the vexing issue of trying to get them all to align on a wafer. </font>The introduction of graphene seemed to take the final bit of luster off of carbon nanotubes’ shine, but the material, which researchers have been using to make transistors for over 20 years, has experienced a renaissance of late. Now, researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison) have given SWCNTs a new boost in their resurgence by using them to make a transistor that outperforms state-of-the-art silicon transistors. “This achievement has been a dream of nanotechnology for the last 20 years,” said Michael Arnold, a professor at UW-Madison, in a press release. “Making carbon nanotube transistors that are better than silicon transistors is a big milestone,” Arnold added. “[It’s] a critical advance toward exploiting carbon nanotubes in logic, high-speed communications, and other semiconductor electronics technologies.” In research described in the journal Science Advances, the UW-Madison researchers were able to achieve a current that is 1.9 times as fast as that seen in silicon transistors. The measure of how rapidly the current that can travel through the channel between a transistor’s source and drain determines how fast the circuit is. The more current there is, the more quickly the gate of the next device in the circuit can be charged . The key to getting the nanotubes to create such a fast transistor was a new process that employs polymers to sort between the metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs to create an ultra-high purity of solution. “We’ve identified specific conditions in which you can get rid of nearly all metallic nanotubes, [leaving] less than 0.01 percent metallic nanotubes [in a sample],” said Arnold.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- IEEE Spectrum, 9/06/2016</em></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></font><br>

Directed self-assembly is a large-scale, nano-patterning technique that can increase the density of circuit patterns and circumvent some limitations of conventional lithographic processes for printing circuits on wafers of semiconductors such as silicon. Electrical engineer Zhenqiang &quot;Jack&quot; Ma and materials engineer Michael Arnold of UW–Madison, chemical engineer Paul Nealey of the University of Chicago, and their students published details of the advance in the Aug. 16 edition of the journal Scientific Reports. Their work could mean a boost in functionality for semiconductor electronics and in capacity for data storage. To achieve the incredibly tiny size required for the circuitry in future semiconductor electronics, manufacturers are developing directed self-assembly, which enables the fabrication of intricate, perfectly ordered polymer patterns for circuitry. For directed self-assembly, the researchers use conventional chemical techniques to define a pre-pattern. When chains of molecules known as block copolymers self-assemble on the pre-pattern, they follow the pattern to form well-ordered features. The researchers' new method is much faster, and reduces the number of steps in the process to just two: lithography and plasma etching. In the first demonstration of their technique, the researchers used electron beam lithography and a mild plasma etching technique to pattern one-atom-thick graphene stripes on a germanium wafer. Then they spin-coated the wafer with a common block copolymer called polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate).</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/09/2016</em></font></font><strong><strong><br>

The experimental prototypes are lightweight, conform to the shape of the body, and can generate far more electricity than previous lightweight heat harvesting technologies. </font><strong>The researchers also identified the optimal site on the body for heat harvesting. </strong>&quot;Wearable thermoelectric generators (TEGs) generate electricity by making use of the temperature differential between your body and the ambient air,&quot; says Daryoosh Vashaee, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at NC State and corresponding author of a paper on the work. &quot;Previous approaches either made use of heat sinks -- which are heavy, stiff and bulky -- or were able to generate only one microwatt or less of power per centimeter squared (μW/cm2). Our technology generates up to 20 μW/cm2 and doesn't use a heat sink, making it lighter and much more comfortable.&quot; The new design begins with a layer of thermally conductive material that rests on the skin and spreads out the heat. The conductive material is topped with a polymer layer that prevents the heat from dissipating through to the outside air. This forces the body heat to pass through a centrally-located TEG that is one cm2. Heat that is not converted into electricity passes through the TEG into an outer layer of thermally conductive material, which rapidly dissipates the heat. The entire system is thin -- only 2 millimeters -- and flexible. &quot;In this prototype, the TEG is only one centimeter squared, but we can easily make it larger, depending on a device's power needs,&quot; says Vashaee, who worked on the project as part of the National Science Foundation's Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for Advanced Self-Powered Systems of Integrated Sensors and Technologies (ASSIST) at NC State.</font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/12/2016</em></font></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Engineers at North Carolina State University and at Intel have come up with a solution to one of the modern microprocessor’s most persistent problems: communication between the processor’s many cores. Their answer is a dedicated set of logic circuits they call the Queue Management Device, or QMD. In simulations, integrating the QMD with the processor’s on-chip network, at a minimum, doubled core-to-core communication speed, and in some cases, boosted it much farther. Even better, as the number of cores was increased, the speed-up became more pronounced. In the last decade, microprocessor designers started putting multiple copies of processor cores on a single die as a way to continue the rate of performance improvement computer makers had enjoyed without chip-killing hot spots forming on the CPU. But that solution comes with complications. For one, it meant that software programs had to be written so that work was divided among processor cores. The result: Sometimes different cores would need to work on the same data or have to coordinate the passing of data from one core to another. To prevent the cores from wantonly overwriting each other’s information, processing data out of order, or committing other errors, multicore processors use lock-protected software queues. These are data structures that coordinate the movement of and access to information according to software-defined rules. But all that extra software comes with significant overhead, which only gets worse as the number of cores increases. “Communications between cores is becoming a bottleneck,” says Yan Solihin, a professor of electrical and computer engineering who led the work at NC State. The solution—born of a discussion with Intel engineers and executed by Solihin's student, Yipeng Wang, at NC State and at Intel—was to turn the software queue into hardware. This effectively turned three multistep software queue operations into three simple instructions—add data to the queue, take data from the queue, and put data near where it’s going to be needed next. Compared with just using the software solution, the QMD sped up a sample task such as packet processing—like network nodes do on the Internet—by a greater and greater amount the more cores were involved. For 16 cores, QMD worked 20 times as fast as the software could. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font color="#999999" size="2">-</font></font><font size="2"><em>- IEEE Spectrum, 9/12/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the differences between lasers and desk lamps is that laser light is spatially coherent, meaning the peaks and valleys of the light waves are correlated with each other. The jumbled, uncorrelated waves coming from a desk lamp, on the other hand, are often said to be incoherent. That's a bit of a misnomer, however. In theory, virtually all light—even &quot;incoherent&quot; light—can have a high degree of spatial coherence. But detecting that coherence requires probing light at extremely small length scales that cannot be accessed using traditional techniques. Now, researchers in the lab of Domenico Pacifici, professor in Brown University's School of Engineering, have found a way to detect spatial coherence in light beams at the scale of a few hundred nanometers—a much smaller scale than has ever been possible. The research provides the first experimental verification of optical coherence theory at the nanoscale. &quot;There's a very small length scale at which light that's often said to be incoherent behaves coherently, but we've lacked experimental techniques to quantify it,&quot; said Drew Morrill, lead author of an article describing the new research. &quot;That degree of coherence contains meaningful information we can now access, which could be useful in characterizing light sources and potentially for new imaging and microscopy techniques.&quot; Morrill, now a graduate student at the University of Colorado, performed the work as an undergraduate at Brown. The research paper, coauthored with Pacifici and Brown postdoctoral scholar Dongfang Li, is published in Nature Photonics. Traditional methods for testing the extent to which light is spatially coherent involve devices that can split the wavefront of a light beam. The most famous of these is the Young interferometer, also known as the double slit experiment. The experiment consists of a light source aimed at a detector screen, with an opaque barrier between the two. The barrier has two small slits in it, allowing two rays of light to pass through. As the two rays emerge from the slits, some of the light waves are bent toward each other, causing them to recombine. Recombining waves that are coherent will create an interference pattern—a series of light and dark patches—on the detector screen. By measuring the contrast of those light and dark patches, researchers can quantify the light's coherence.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/16/2016</em></font></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Emotions can be detected remotely using a device that emits wireless signals to help it measure heartbeat and breathing, say researchers at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. The new device, named “EQ-Radio,” is 87 percent accurate at detecting whether a person is excited, happy, angry or sad—all without on-body sensors or facial-recognition software. “We picture EQ-Radio being used in entertainment, consumer behavior, and healthcare,” says the study’s lead researcher, Mingmin Zhao. “For example,” says Zhao, a graduate student, “smart homes could use information about your emotions to adjust the music or even suggest that you get some fresh air if you've been sad for a few days.” Zhao adds that remote emotion monitoring could eventually be used to diagnose or track conditions like depression and anxiety.” Zhao and study co-authors Dina Katabi and Fadel Adib will present their work in October at the Association of Computing Machinery's International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (MobiCom) in New York. Existing technologies for detecting emotion require on-body sensors or audiovisual cues, but there are downsides to both these methods. For example, on-body sensors such as chest bands and ECG monitors are inconvenient to wear and become less accurate if they shift position over time. Systems that rely on audiovisual cues require people to face cameras, and can miss subtle facial expressions. Instead, EQ-Radio emits radio signals that reflect off a person's body and back to the device. Its algorithms can detect individual heartbeats from these radio echoes with an accuracy comparable to on-body ECG monitors. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font color="#999999" size="2">-</font></font><font size="2"><em>- IEEE Spectrum, 9/20/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A year ago, researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory unveiled a fundamentally new way of managing memory on computer chips, one that would use circuit space much more efficiently as chips continue to comprise more and more cores, or processing units. In chips with hundreds of cores, the researchers’ scheme could free up somewhere between 15 and 25 percent of on-chip memory, enabling much more efficient computation. Their scheme, however, assumed a certain type of computational behavior that most modern chips do not, in fact, enforce. Last week, at the International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques — the same conference where they first reported their scheme — the researchers presented an updated version that’s more consistent with existing chip designs and has a few additional improvements. The essential challenge posed by multicore chips is that they execute instructions in parallel, while in a traditional computer program, instructions are written in sequence. Computer scientists are constantly working on ways to make parallelization easier for computer programmers. The initial version of the MIT researchers’ scheme, called Tardis, enforced a standard called sequential consistency. Suppose that different parts of a program contain the sequences of instructions ABC and XYZ. When the program is parallelized, A, B, and C get assigned to core 1; X, Y, and Z to core 2.</font>  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font color="#999999" size="2">-</font></font><font size="2"><em>- MITNews, 9/21/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The deep-learning software driving the modern artificial intelligence revolution has mostly run on fairly standard computer hardware. Some tech giants such as Google and Intel have focused some of their considerable resources on creating more specialized computer chips designed for deep learning. But IBM has taken a more unusual approach: It is testing its brain-inspired TrueNorth computer chip as a hardware platform for deep learning. Deep learning’s powerful capabilities rely on algorithms called convolutional neural networks that consist of layers of nodes (also known as neurons). Such neural networks can filter huge amounts of data through their “deep” layers to become better at, say, automatically recognizing individual human faces or understanding different languages. These are the types of capabilities that already empower online services offered by the likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft. In recent research, IBM has shown that such deep-learning algorithms could run on brain-inspired hardware that typically supports a very different type of neural network. IBM published a paper on its work in the 9 September 2016 issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The research was funded with just under $1 million from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Such funding formed part of DARPA’s Cortical Processor program aimed at brain-inspired AI that can recognize complex patterns and adapt to changing environments. “The new milestone provides a palpable proof of concept that the efficiency of brain-inspired computing can be merged with the effectiveness of deep learning, paving the path towards a new generation of chips and algorithms with even greater efficiency and effectiveness,” says Dharmendra Modha, chief scientist for brain-inspired computing at IBM Research-Almaden, in San Jose, Calif. IBM first laid down the specifications for TrueNorth and a prototype chip in 2011. So, TrueNorth predated—and was therefore never specifically designed to harness—the deep-learning revolution based on convolutional neural networks that took off starting in 2012. Instead, TrueNorth typically supports spiking neural networks that more closely mimic the way real neurons work in biological brains. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font color="#999999" size="2">-</font></font><font size="2"><em>- IEEE Spectrum, 9/27/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To a human brain, picking one particular image out of a thousand is an easy task. Billions of neurons and the synapses that connect them can quickly process information in parallel to make a decision. Seeking to make such processing that easy for machines, scientists and engineers have been working with devices called memristors, which have some similar behaviors to neural synapses. Engineers at the University of Massachusetts report this week that they’ve invented a memristor circuit that matches a synapses’ behavior more closely than any before. First predicted in 1971 and invented in 2008 by HP, memristors are so named because they remember how much voltage you applied across the device and how long you applied it, storing the information as a change in resistance. HP engineers noticed immediately that such a characteristic was similar to the way the synaptic connection between neurons strengthens with use to form a memory. Memristors are “kind of the ideal candidate in many aspect” says Jianhua Yang, an electrical engineer at the University of Massachusetts Amherst working on improving their behavior. Low-power, simple circuits of memristors could improve the ability of computers to solve power-intensive computer vision and machine learning tasks that human brains handle with little effort. In research published in Nature Materials on 26 September, Yang and his team mimicked a crucial underlying component of how synaptic connections get stronger or weaker: the flow of calcium. The movement of calcium into or out of the neuronal membrane, neuroscientists have found, directly affects the connection. Chemical processes move the calcium in and out— triggering a long-term change in the synapses’ strength. 2015 research in ACS NanoLetters and Advanced Functional Materials discovered that types of memristors can simulate some of the calcium behavior, but not all.  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font color="#999999" size="2">-</font></font><font size="2"><em>- IEEE Spectrum, 9/29/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font><br>

Light scattered by the tissue phantom was then collected by a high-speed camera, which could measure the light’s time of arrival.</font></em></td>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MIT researchers have developed a technique for recovering visual information from light that has scattered because of interactions with the environment — such as passing through human tissue. The technique could lead to medical-imaging systems that use visible light, which carries much more information than X-rays or ultrasound waves, or to computer vision systems that work in fog or drizzle. The development of such vision systems has been a major obstacle to self-driving cars. In experiments, the researchers fired a laser beam through a “mask” — a thick sheet of plastic with slits cut through it in a certain configuration, such as the letter A — and then through a 1.5-centimeter “tissue phantom,” a slab of material designed to mimic the optical properties of human tissue for purposes of calibrating imaging systems. Light scattered by the tissue phantom was then collected by a high-speed camera, which could measure the light’s time of arrival. From that information, the researchers’ algorithms were able to reconstruct an accurate image of the pattern cut into the mask. “The reason our eyes are sensitive only in this narrow part of the spectrum is because this is where light and matter interact most,” says Guy Satat, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab and first author on the new paper. “This is why X-ray is able to go inside the body, because there is very little interaction. That’s why it can’t distinguish between different types of tissue, or see bleeding, or see oxygenated or deoxygenated blood.” The imaging technique’s potential applications in automotive sensing may be even more compelling than those in medical imaging, however. Many experimental algorithms for guiding autonomous vehicles are highly reliable under good illumination, but they fall apart completely in fog or drizzle; computer vision systems misinterpret the scattered light as having reflected off of objects that don’t exist. The new technique could address that problem. Satat’s coauthors on the new paper, published today in Scientific Reports, are three other members of the Media Lab’s Camera Culture group: Ramesh Raskar, the group’s leader, Satat’s thesis advisor, and an associate professor of media arts and sciences; Barmak Heshmat, a research scientist; and Dan Raviv, a postdoc.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font color="#999999" size="2">-</font></font><font size="2"><em>- MITNews, 9/29/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font><br>

    <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These mind-boggling materials allow electric current to flow freely without resistance. But that generally only happens at temperatures within a few degrees of absolute zero (minus 459 degrees Fahrenheit), making them difficult to deploy today. However, if we’re able to harness the powers of superconductivity at room temperature, we could transform how energy is produced, stored, distributed and used around the globe. In a recent breakthrough, scientists at the Department of Energy’s Brookhaven National Laboratory got one step closer to understanding how to make that possible. The research, led by physicist Ivan Bozovic, involves a class of compounds called cuprates, which contain layers of copper and oxygen atoms. Under the right conditions -- which, right now, include ultra-chilly temperatures -- electrical current flows freely through these cuprate superconductors without encountering any “roadblocks” along the way. That means none of the electrical energy they’re carrying gets converted to heat. If you’ve ever rested your laptop on your lap, you’ve felt the heat lost by a non-superconducting material. Creating the right conditions for superconductivity in cuprates also involves adding other chemical elements such as strontium. Somehow, adding those atoms and chilling the material causes electrons -- which normally repel one another -- to pair up and effortlessly move together through the material. What makes cuprates so special is that they can achieve this “magical” state of matter at temperatures a hundred degrees or more above those required by standard superconductors. That makes them very promising for real-world, energy-saving applications. These materials wouldn’t require any cooling, so they’d be relatively easy and inexpensive to incorporate into our everyday lives. Picture power grids that never lose energy, more affordablemag-lev train systems, cheaper medical imaging machines like MRI scanners, and smaller yet powerful supercomputers. To figure out the mystery of “high-temperature” superconductivity in the cuprates, scientists need to understand how the electrons in these materials behave. Bozovic’s team has now solved part of the mystery by determining what exactly controls the temperature at which cuprates become superconducting. </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/30/2016</em></font></font><br>

    <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Battery researchers have been focusing on lithium metal electrodes as leading contenders for improving the amount of energy that batteries can store without increasing their weight. But lithium in this metallic form has a problem that has stymied much of this research effort: As the batteries are being charged, finger-like lithium deposits form on the metal surface, which can hamper performance and even lead to short-circuits that damage or disable the battery. Now, a team of researchers at MIT says it has carried out the most detailed analysis yet of exactly how these deposits form, and reports that there are two entirely different mechanisms at work. While both forms of deposits are composed of lithium filaments, the way they grow depends on the applied current. Clustered, “mossy” deposits, which form at low rates, turn out to grow from their roots and can be relatively easy to control. The much more sparse and rapidly advancing “dendritic” projections grow only at their tips. The dendritic type, the researchers say, are harder to deal with and are responsible for most of the problems. Their findings are reported this week in the journal Energy and Environmental Science, in a paper by Peng Bai, a senior postdoc; Ju Li, the Battelle Energy Alliance Professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering and a professor of materials science and engineering; Fikile Brushett, an assistant professor of chemical engineering; and Martin Z. Bazant, the E. G. Roos (1944) Professor of Chemical Engineering and a professor of mathematics. This research provides “fundamental experimental and theoretical insights into the growth of lithium metal, showing that there are really two different kinds of growth,” Bazant says. Although it was known that such growth occurs on lithium surfaces, this is the first study to show the two different types — mossy, which grows slowly from the base, and dendritic, which extends rapidly from the growing tips. While previous research has always lumped the two types of growth together under the blanket term “dendrites,” he says, the new work demonstrates the precise conditions for each distinct growth mode to occur, and how the mossy type can be relatively easily controlled.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>-- MIT News, 9/01/2016</em></font></font></font><br>

Perovskites are optically active, semiconducting compounds that are known to display intriguing electronic, light-emitting and chemical properties. Over the last few years, lead-halide perovskites have become one of the most promising semiconductors for solar cells due to their low cost, easier processability and high power conversion efficiencies. Photovoltaics made of these materials now reach power conversion efficiencies of more than 20 percent. Vela's research has focused on mixed-halide perovskites. Halides are simple and abundant, negatively charged compounds, such as iodide, bromide and chloride. Mixed-halide perovskites are of interest over single-halide perovskites for a variety of reasons. Mixed-halide perovskites appear to benefit from enhanced thermal and moisture stability, which makes them degrade less quickly than single-halide perovskites, Vela said. He added they can be fine-tuned to absorb sunlight at specific wavelengths, which makes them useful for tandem solar cells and many other applications, including light emitting diodes (LEDs).Using these compounds, scientists can control the color and efficiency of such energy conversion devices. Speculating that these enhancements had something to do with the internal structure of mixed-halide perovskites, Vela, who is also an associate professor of chemistry at Iowa State University (ISU), worked with scientists with expertise in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at both Ames Laboratory and ISU. NMR is an analytical chemistry technique that provides scientists with physical, chemical, structural and electronic information about complex samples. &quot;Our basic question was what it is about these materials in terms of their chemistry, composition, and structure that can affect their behavior,&quot; said Vela. Scientists found that depending on how the material is made there can be significant nonstoichiometric impurities or &quot;dopants&quot; permeating the material, which could significantly affect the material's chemistry, moisture stability and transport properties.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/07/2016</em></font><strong><br>

    <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fuel cells provide power without pollutants. But, as in the Goldilocks story, membranes in automobile fuel cells work at temperatures either too hot or too cold to be maximally effective. A polyphenyline membrane patented by Sandia National Laboratories, though, seems to work just about right, says Sandia chemist Cy Fujimoto. </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The membrane, which operates over a wide temperature range, lasts three times longer than comparable commercial products, Fujimoto and his co-authors say in the Aug. 21 issue of Nature Energy. Fuel-cell PEMs (proton-exchange membranes) allow the excretion of protons — the husk, in a sense — of the material providing the electrons that form the fuel cell’s electrical output. If the protons can’t pass easily within the cell, the fettered flow reduces the electrical output. Currently commercial PEMs in most fuel-cell-powered vehicles require water, so their operating temperature can’t get higher than water’s boiling point. Higher temperatures dry out the membrane, increase cell resistance and reduce performance, said Fujimoto. “Part of the issues with the current PEMs is that you need to hydrate the hydrogen fuel stream for high performance, and the fuel cell can’t run effectively at temperatures higher than the boiling point of water,” he said. “This problem can be solved by employing hydrated fuel streams and having a larger radiator to more effectively dissipate waste heat,” Fujimoto continued. “Automakers are doing this now. But if PEM fuel cells didn’t need water to run, it would make things a lot simpler.” Another problem is that material costs for the current membrane of choice can be approximately $250-$500 per square meter. “The DOE [Department of Energy] would like to see $5 to $20 a square meter,” Fujimoto said. Researchers have tried to solve these problems with a high-temperature method that uses phosphoric acid to dope a polybenzimidazole membrane at more than 350 degrees Fahrenheit. But the membrane can’t operate below 284 degrees without degrading the phosphoric acid. Thus the membrane is unsuitable for automotive applications, where water condensation from cold engine start-ups and other normal reactions at the fuel cell cathode unavoidably bring the temperature down into undesirable ranges that leach the phosphoric acid out of the reaction.</font> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>- R&amp;D Mag, 9/08/2016</em></font></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Ames Laboratory, in collaboration with several partners, have discovered a less-expensive, more energy-efficient way to produce alane – aluminum trihydride – a hydrogen source widely considered to be a technological dead-end for use in automotive vehicles. Alane had earned its dead-end reputation for use in cars because making it from the elements aluminum and hydrogen at equilibrium requires hydrogen gas at about 150,000 PSI pressure. Researchers found that atomic-level defects, when present on the surface of aluminum together with hydrogen and titanium, created the conditions necessary for a chemical reaction producing alane to occur, and without the need for hydrogen at tremendously high pressure. While not ready for mainstream synthesis, this work serves as proof of concept of a more efficient and less costly way of producing alane. &quot;Alane is great because it meets all of the criteria put forth by the Department of Energy for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for energy capacity, weight, system temperature, and cost,&quot; said Vitalij Pecharsky, Ames Laboratory Scientist and Iowa State University's Anson Marston Distinguished Professor of Materials Science. &quot;Aluminum is cheap, hydrogen is abundant. There's just one problem: you can't make it easily. For the longest time it's been considered impossible to use for vehicle applications because of the extreme difficulties in producing it.&quot; Researchers paired the predictive advantages of computational analysis with physical experiment to tackle the applied materials challenge. Along with titanium catalyst dopants and hydrogen, theorists looked at vacancy defects, or missing aluminum, on the surface of aluminum powders and established that this combination working in concert is critical to the low-energy formation of alane. Because such defects can be produced by ball milling to break up mechanically the atomic structure of the metal, experimentalists ball-milled aluminum powders in combination with hydrogen and titanium, and they confirmed the prediction by producing AlH3, or alane. The process used significantly less pressure, only about 5,000 PSI (or 30 times less pressure), to create alane than that needed for equilibrium methods. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style57"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/23/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></span></font></font>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a discovery that could have profound implications for future energy policy, Columbia scientists have demonstrated it is possible to manufacture solar cells that are far more efficient than existing silicon energy cells by using a new kind of material, a development that could help reduce fossil fuel consumption. The team, led by Xiaoyang Zhu, a professor of Chemistry at Columbia University, focused its efforts on a new class of solar cell ingredients known as Hybrid Organic Inorganic Perovskites (HOIPs). Their results, reported in the prestigious journal Science, also explain why these new materials are so much more efficient than traditional solar cells—solving a mystery that will likely prompt scientists and engineers to begin inventing new solar materials with similar properties in the years ahead. &quot;The need for renewable energy has motivated extensive research into solar cell technologies that are economically competitive with burning fossil fuel,&quot; Zhu says. &quot;Among the materials being explored for next generation solar cells, HOIPs have emerged a superstar. Until now no one has been able to explain why they work so well, and how much better we might make them. We now know it's possible to make HOIP-based solar cells even more efficient than anyone thought possible.&quot; Solar cells are what turn sunlight into electricity. Also known as photovoltaic cells, these semiconductors are most frequently made from thin layers of silicon that transmit energy across its structure, turning it into DC current. Silicon panels, which currently dominate the market for solar panels, must have a purity of 99.999 percent and are notoriously fragile and expensive to manufacture. Even a microscopic defect—such as misplaced, missing or extra ions—in this crystalline structure can exert a powerful pull on the charges the cells generate when they absorb sunlight, dissipating those charges before they can be transformed into electrical current. In 2009, Japanese scientists demonstrated it was possible to build solar cells out of HOIPs, and that these cells could harvest energy from sunlight even when the crystals had a significant number of defects. Because they don't need to be pristine, HOIPs can be produced on a large scale and at low cost. The Columbia team has been investigating HOIPs since 2014. Their findings could help boost the use of solar power, a priority in the age of global warming. <span class="style57"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/23/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></span><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">As solar cells produce a greater proportion of total electric power, a fundamental limitation remains: the dark of night when solar cells go to sleep. Lithium-ion batteries, the commonplace batteries used in everything from hybrid vehicles to laptop computers, are too expensive a solution to use on something as massive as the electric grid. Song Jin, a professor of chemistry at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, has a better idea: integrating the solar cell with a large-capacity battery. He and his colleagues have made a single device that eliminates the usual intermediate step of making electricity and, instead, transfers the energy directly to the battery’s electrolyte. Jin chose a “redox flow battery,” or RFB, which stores energy in a tank of liquid electrolyte. In a report now online in Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Jin, graduate student Wenjie Li, and colleagues at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia have demonstrated a single device that converts light energy into chemical energy by directly charging the liquid electrolyte. Discharging the battery to power the electric grid at night could hardly be simpler, Jin says. “We just connect a load to a different set of electrodes, pass the charged electrolyte through the device, and the electricity flows out.” Solar charging and electrical discharging, he notes, can be repeated for many cycles with little efficiency loss. Unlike lithium-ion batteries, which store energy in solid electrodes, the RFB stores chemical energy in liquid electrolyte. “The RFB is relatively cheap and you can build a device with as much storage as you need, which is why it is the most promising approach for grid-level electricity storage,” says Jin, who also works on several other aspects of solar energy conversion. In the new device, standard silicon solar cells are mounted on the reaction chamber and energy converted by the cell immediately charges the water-based electrolyte, which is pumped out to a storage tank. Redox flow batteries already on the market have been attached to solar cells, “but now we have one device that harvests sunlight to liberate electrical charges and directly changes the oxidation-reduction state of the electrolyte on the surface of the cells,” says Li, the first author of the new study. “We are using a single device to convert solar energy and charge a battery. It’s essentially a solar battery, and we can size the RFB storage tank to store all the energy generated by the solar cells.”

Unfortunately, the halogen-containing solvents used in their manufacture are an obstacle to large-scale commercialization. These solvents are key to making sure that the solar cell's morphology, or structure, maximizes its energy efficiency; however, they are environmentally hazardous. Additionally, the use of these harsh chemicals requires a controlled environment, which adds to production costs. Long Ye, a postdoctoral research scholar in physics at NC State and lead author of a paper describing the work, wanted to find out if nontoxic solvents could provide equally efficient morphology in the manufacturing process. Ye and his colleagues developed a proof of concept semi-printed plastic solar cell that utilized o-methylanisole (o-MA) as the solvent. O-MA is a commonly used flavoring agent in foods, and is nontoxic to humans. The researchers used soft X-ray techniques to study the morphology of their solar cell. They found that the o-MA based solar cell had similar morphology, crystalline features and device performance to those produced by halogenated solvents. The solar cell's overall efficiency rating was around 8.4 percent. Furthermore, their cell could be produced via blade coating at ambient, or room temperature. Blade coating is a process that uses a glass blade to spread a thin layer of the photovoltaic film onto either a rigid or flexible substrate, and the process is compatible with large-scale commercial manufacturing.</font><em> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><span class="style57"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/29/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></span></font></font><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><br>

This new material works by allowing the body to discharge heat in two ways that would make the wearer feel nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than if they wore cotton clothing. The material cools by letting perspiration evaporate through the material, something ordinary fabrics already do. But the Stanford material provides a second, revolutionary cooling mechanism: allowing heat that the body emits as infrared radiation to pass through the plastic textile. All objects, including our bodies, throw off heat in the form of infrared radiation, an invisible and benign wavelength of light. Blankets warm us by trapping infrared heat emissions close to the body. This thermal radiation escaping from our bodies is what makes us visible in the dark through night-vision goggles. “Forty to 60 percent of our body heat is dissipated as infrared radiation when we are sitting in an office,” said Shanhui Fan, a professor of electrical engineering who specializes in photonics, which is the study of visible and invisible light. “But until now there has been little or no research on designing the thermal radiation characteristics of textiles.”<strong> Super-powered kitchen wrap: </strong>To develop their cooling textile, the Stanford researchers blended nanotechnology, photonics and chemistry to give polyethylene – the clear, clingy plastic we use as kitchen wrap – a number of characteristics desirable in clothing material: It allows thermal radiation, air and water vapor to pass right through, and it is opaque to visible light.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- Stanford News, 9/01/2016</em></font></font></font></font> </font></font><br>

    <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial"> Collaborative research at Notre Dame has demonstrated that electronic interactions play a significant role in the dimensional crossover of semiconductor nanomaterials. The laboratory of Masaru Kuno, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and the condensed matter theory group of Boldizsar Janko, professor of physics, have now shown that a critical length scale marks the transition between a zero-dimensional, quantum dot and a one-dimensional nanowire. </font>The findings, &quot;Dimensional crossover in semiconductor nanostructures,&quot; were published in Nature Communications. Matthew McDonald and Rusha Chatterjee of Kuno's laboratory and Jixin Si of Janko's group are also authors of the publication. A quantum dot structure possesses the same physical dimensions in every direction while a quantum wire exhibits one dimension longer than the others. This means that quantum dots and nanowires made of the same material exhibit different optical and electrical responses at the nanoscale since these properties are exquisitely size- and shape-dependent. Understanding the size- and shape-dependent evolution of nanomaterial properties has therefore been a central focus of nanoscience over the last two decades. However, it has never been definitively established how a quantum dot evolves into a nanowire as its aspect ratio is made progressively larger. Do quantum properties evolve gradually or do they suddenly transition? Kuno's laboratory discovered that a critical length exists where a quantum dot becomes nanowire-like. The researchers achieved this breakthrough by conducting the first direct, single particle absorption measurements on individual semiconductor nanorods, an intermediate species between quantum dots and nanowires. Single particle rather than ensemble measurements were used to avoid the effects of sample inhomogeneities. Furthermore, an absorption approach rather than an often-used emission approach was employed to circumvent existing limitations of modern emission-based single particle microscopy-namely, its restriction to the observation of highly fluorescent specimens. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/01/2016<br>

    <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All polymers have a distinctive degree of elasticity — how much they will stretch when a force is applied. However, for the past 100 years, polymer scientists have been stymied in their efforts to predict polymers’ elasticity, because the materials usually have structural flaws at the molecular level that impact elasticity in unknown ways. By coming up with a way to measure these structural defects, MIT researchers have now shown that they can accurately calculate the elasticity of polymer networks such as hydrogels. “This is the first time anyone has developed a predictive theory of elasticity in a polymer network, which is something that many have said over the years was impossible to do,” says Jeremiah Johnson, the Firmenich Career Development Associate Professor of Chemistry at MIT. This theory could make it much easier for scientists to design materials with a specific elasticity, which is now more of a trial-and-error process. Bradley Olsen, an associate professor of chemical engineering, and Johnson are the senior authors of the new study, which appears in the Sept. 15 online edition of Science. The paper’s lead authors are former MIT postdoc Mingjiang Zhong, postdoc Rui Wang, and graduate student Ken Kawamoto.</font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000"><font color="#808080"><strong><font color="#000000">Counting loops</font></strong></font></font></font></font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>: </strong></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Polymers, or long chains of repeating molecules, are found in many objects that we encounter every day, including anything made of plastic or rubber.

These loops also make it impossible to accurately calculate the material’s elasticity, because existing formulas for this calculation assume that the material has no defects.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2"><em> -- MIT News, 9/15/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><br>

    The University of Wisconsin–Madison College of Engineering is the new home of a unique machine capable of milling in three dimensions with nanometer precision. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The machine, called the ROBONANO α-0iB, is the first of its kind in North America, and offers the sort of advanced technological capabilities that represent the future of advanced manufacturing. The ROBONANO is on a multiyear loan from the Japanese robotics manufacturer FANUC to the laboratory of Sangkee Min, a UW–Madison professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Grainger Institute for Engineering. The ROBONANO’s capabilities offer Min and colleagues new research opportunities, which he hopes will lead to improved approaches to the manufacturing of everything from semiconductors to toys and mobile devices to scientific instruments. The 5-axis machine has nearly limitless configurations for cutting, scribing and milling materials, but ROBONANO’s superiority over previous generations of similar machines is obvious: Its ability to cut at the nanoscale is two orders of magnitude more precise than most machines used in advanced manufacturing today. “Many materials have different properties at the nanoscale that create all sorts of different possibilities that aren’t possible with conventional machines,” says Min. He will explore ROBONANO’s suitability for manufacturing emerging materials — as well as available materials like synthetic sapphire, a promising shatter-proof alternative to glass for screens on devices such as tablets and smartphones. Made from heating aluminum oxide to extremely high temperatures, synthetic sapphire is difficult to manufacture at large scales because it is very brittle and difficult to handle. However, Min’s initial research on synthetic sapphire with the ROBONANO in Japan showed that the material can be far more pliable when handled at the nano level. Min also hopes to explore how machining on the nano scale can open new possibilities for manufacturing design. Most designers are constrained by manufacturing limitations that can choke creativity and slow innovation. Min points to smartphone design as a prime example of this “design for manufacturing” paradigm leading to stale product lines.<font size="3"> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/16/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><br>

    Graphene is the stuff of the future. For years, researchers and technologists have been predicting the utility of the one-atom-thick sheets of pure carbon in everything from advanced touch screens and semiconductors to long-lasting batteries and next-generation solar cells. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But graphene's unique intrinsic properties – supreme electrical and thermal conductivities and remarkable electron mobility, to name just a few – can only be fully realized if it is grown free from defects that disrupt the honeycomb pattern of the bound carbon atoms. A team led by Materials Scientist Anirudha Sumant with the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory's Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) and Materials Science Division, along with collaborators at the University of California-Riverside, has developed a method to grow graphene that contains relatively few impurities and costs less to make, in a shorter time and at lower temperatures compared to the processes widely used to make graphene today. Theoretical work led by Argonne nanoscientist Subramanian Sankaranarayanan at the CNM helped researchers understand the molecular-level processes underlying the graphene growth. &quot;I'd been dealing with all these different techniques of growing graphene, and you never see such a uniform, smooth surface.&quot; The new technology taps ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD), a synthetic type of diamond that Argonne researchers have pioneered through years of research. UNCD serves as a physical substrate, or surface on which the graphene grows, and the source for the carbon atoms that make up a rapidly produced graphene sheet. &quot;When I first looked at the [scanning electron micrograph] and saw this nice uniform, very complete layer, it was amazing,&quot; said Diana Berman, the first author of the study and former postdoctoral research associate who worked with Sumant and is now an Assistant Professor at the University of North Texas. &quot;I'd been dealing with all these different techniques of growing graphene, and you never see such a uniform, smooth surface.&quot; Current graphene fabrication protocols introduce impurities during the etching process itself, which involves adding acid and extra polymers, and when they are transferred to a different substrate for use in electronics.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/19/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><br>

    Light-emitting, four-armed nanocrystals could someday form the basis of an early warning system in structural materials by revealing microscopic cracks that portend failure, thanks to recent research by scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The researchers embedded tetrapod-shaped quantum dots, which are nanosized semiconducting particles, in a polymer film. The tetrapods' cores emit fluorescent light when their arms are twisted or bent out of shape. This indicates the polymer is undergoing a degree of tensile or compressive strain, from which stress over sub-micron-scale regions of the material can be detected. Such stress can cause nanoscale cracks to develop into macroscopic failure. Initial tests show the tetrapods can cycle more than 20 times without losing their ability to sense stress, and they don't degrade the strength of the polymer in which they're matrixed. So far the scientists have tested their approach in the lab, but in practice, all that would be needed to detect the tetrapods' fluorescent warning is an off-the-shelf, portable spectrometer. A person could point a spectrometer at a steel beam, airplane wing, or any material that has the tetrapods embedded inside, and the spectrometer could potentially detect incipient cracks that are only 100 nanometers long. &quot;This is the length scale at which cracks develop, which is when you want to catch them, well before the material fails,&quot; says Shilpa Raja, who conducted the research while she was an affiliate in Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division and a PhD student at UC Berkeley. Raja is now a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University. Robert Ritchie and Paul Alivisatos, also of the Materials Sciences Division and UC Berkeley, are the co-corresponding authors of a paper on this research published online in the journal Nano Letters (2016, vol. 16, issue 8, pgs. 5060-5067). &quot;Our approach could also be a big step toward self-healing smart materials. The tetrapods could be coupled with nanosized repair particles to form a material that senses local stress and then repairs itself,&quot; adds Raja.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/20/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><br>

    With the help of camera-guided endoscopes, clinicians get a look inside the body's cavities to diagnose and treat many different conditions. In the United States alone, up to 20 million endoscopies are performed on patients every year. But even for the most seasoned endoscope users, the instruments can prove very challenging to use effectively; this is due to the fact that blood and other bodily fluids quite commonly obscure the camera lens in the midst of critical procedures. This problem inspired a team led by Joanna Aizenberg, Amy Smith Berylson Professor of Materials Science and Professor of Chemistry &amp; Chemical Biology at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and Core Faculty member of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, to engineer a transparent surface coating for an endoscope lens that could effortlessly keep blood and other fluids at bay. The idea took roots in conversations Aizenberg had with clinician collaborators, who were quick to lament the propensity for endoscopes to become clouded mid-procedure. Turning to the portfolio of SLIPS (Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous Surfaces) technologies already invented by Aizenberg, they set out to design a specialized SLIPS coating that could prevent bodily fluids from blocking the optical field of view of camera-guided endoscopes. The demonstrated results of their work are published online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) journal. &quot;Endoscopes are used by many physicians around the world for a variety of procedures, and ironically, the moment when bleeding occurs and the optical field is blocked is also precisely when physicians most need to see what's happening,&quot; said Aizenberg, who is also the Co-Director of the Kavli Institute for Bionano Science and Technology. Aizenberg's SLIPS technology creates non-wetting and robust self-cleaning surfaces that can resist almost any fouling challenge a surface may face. But to develop the technology for endoscopic use, the team needed to adapt SLIPS specifically to weather the harsh environment of a living body's cavities. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/27/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><br>

    <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Researchers have developed a 3D-printed synthetic bone that overcomes many of the shortcomings of current bone grafting materials. Surgeons successfully used the substance to fuse the spines of rats and repair a skull defect in a monkey, the researchers reported today in Science Translational Medicine. The novel biomaterial is strong, elastic, and capable of helping the body regenerate new bone on its own. Most importantly, the material isn’t brittle, a property that could allow surgeons to trim a piece to fit the patient without it crumbling—a common problem with other synthetic bone constructs. To achieve the effect, researchers used the right combination of starting materials for the ink and printed it at room temperature rather than with heat or lasers, explains Ramille Shah, principle investigator on the paper and biomaterials scientist at Northwestern University. Shah’s team used a type of bioactive ceramic called hydroxyapatite—a material commonly used in attempts at regenerating bone—and added a polymer called polycaprolactone. Then, rather than using hot-melt or laser-based 3D printing, the team used a solvent-based, room-temperature 3D printing technique that relied on a unique combination of three solvents. That improved the microstructure of the ink, says Shah. “It doesn’t dry out right away. It’s a little wet which allows each layer to adhere to the previous one,” she adds. The team dubbed their substance “hyperelastic bone.” The printer they used, called the 3D-Bioplotter System by EnvisionTec, is commercially available and costs US $250,000–$300,000, Shah says. In the rat and monkey experiments, the printed scaffold integrated well into the animals’ bodies. Blood vessels moved into the porous material quickly, and the animals’ immune systems didn’t seem to reject the implant. Over time, the material is expected to biodegrade as the body’s cells naturally regenerate new tissue and replace the synthetic scaffold. <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2"><em> -- IEEE Spectrum, 9/28/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><br>

    Within a few years, the U.S. Department of Energy wants plug-in electric vehicles to be just as affordable and convenient as the internal-combustion machines most of us drive today. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But we’re not there yet. When President Obama and the Department of Energy (DOE) launched the EV (plug-in electric vehicles) Everywhere initiative in 2012, the DOE said electric vehicles need to be 30 percent lighter, battery costs have to drop from $500 per kilowatt hour to $125 per kilowatt hour and electric drive systems must drop from $30 per kilowatt down to $8 per kilowatt. “Typically, in the engineering world, when you have a problem like this, you look at the system, for example the motor design,” said Jun Cui, an Iowa State University associate professor of materials science and engineering and a senior scientist with the DOE’s Ames Laboratory. But electric motors have been around since the 1830s. The easy system solutions were found long ago. “The hard stuff is material-related,” Cui said. “It’s the demand for better materials.” <strong>A new vehicle technologies grant; </strong>A research team led by Cui is working to meet the demand for better materials and performance in electric motors. To support their work, they’ve just won a three-year, $3.8 million grant from the DOE’s Vehicle Technologies Program. Of that, $2.8 million will support research at Iowa State. The project also includes research partners from the United Technologies Research Center in East Hartford, Connecticut; and the University of Delaware in Newark. Cui said the project was made possible by combining the research expertise and facilities of Iowa State and the Ames Laboratory. Local collaborators include Scott Chumbley, a professor of materials science and engineering and scientist for the Ames Laboratory; Peter Collins, the Alan and Julie Renken associate professor of materials science and engineering and an associate scientist of the Ames Laboratory; Iver Anderson, a senior metallurgist for the Ames Laboratory and an adjunct professor of materials science and engineering; Valery Levitas, a Schafer 2050 Challenge Professor of aerospace engineering and an associate scientist of the Ames Laboratory; Frank Peters, an associate professor and associate chair of operations in industrial and manufacturing systems engineering; and Matthew Kramer, director of the Ames Laboratory’s Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering and an adjunct professor of materials science and engineering.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/28/2016</em></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

MirrorLink, created by the Connected Car Consortium, which represents 80 percent of the world's automakers, is the first and leading industry standard for connecting smartphones to in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems. However, some automakers disable it because they chose a different smartphone-to-IVI standard, or because the version of MirrorLink in their vehicles is a prototype that can be activated later. McCoy and his colleagues found that MirrorLink is relatively easy to enable, and when unlocked can allow hackers to use a linked smartphone as a stepping stone to control safety-critical components such as the vehicle's anti-lock braking system. McCoy explained that &quot;tuners&quot; - people or companies who customize automobiles - might unwittingly enable hackers by unlocking insecure features. &quot;Tuners will root around for these kinds of prototypes, and if these systems are easy to unlock they will do it,&quot; he said. &quot;And there are publically available instructions describing how to unlock MirrorLink. Just one of several instructional videos on YouTube has gotten over 60,000 views.&quot; The researchers used such publically available instructions to unlock MirrorLink on the in-vehicle infotainment system in a 2015 vehicle they purchased from eBay for their experiments. The automaker and supplier declined to release a security patch - reflecting the fact that they never enabled MirrorLink. McCoy pointed out that this could leave drivers who enable MirrorLink out on a limb.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style57"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/01/2016</em></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></span><br>

As journalists, we don’t really think through the consequences of always wanting more robots, which (if left unchecked) can lead to an unfortunate case of having too many robots. This becomes particularly problematic when you have so many robots that they spend all of their time trying not to run into each other, and none of their time doing anything productive. </font></span></font></font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At Georgia Tech, Li Wang and professors Aaron D. Ames and Magnus Egerstedt have been developing ways to allow infinitely large teams of mobile robots to move around each other without colliding, and also without getting in each other’s way. This is very important for people like me, who have 37 Roombas at home, but also for anyone imagining a future where roads are packed with autonomous cars. The fundamental issue here is robot paranoia. When robots move around, they typically maintain a sensor-based “panic zone” for safety, and if anything enters that space, they panic, and stop moving. If you have only two robots moving around, they can keep clear of one another, but as the number of robots increases, the odds that two “panic zones” will intersect also increases, to the point where they overlap and you just end up with a completely paralyzing global robot freakout. Or as the Georgia Tech researchers put it (in a much fancier way), “as the number of robots and the complexity of the task increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to design one single controller that simultaneously achieves multiple objectives, e.g., forming shapes, collision avoidance, and connectivity maintenance.” Traditionally, robots use several different control systems to complete tasks. The primary controller is focused on getting the robot to do something, like “go over there.” The secondary controller, or safety controller, make sure that while the primary controller is doing its thing, the robot doesn’t run into stuff. Most of the time, the safety controller is passive, but it can override the primary controller if it thinks there’s danger of a collision. Problems start to happen when the safety controller ends up overriding the primary controller almost all of the time, which means that the robot is so busy “being safe” that it can’t complete its primary goal.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style57"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- IEEE Spectrum, 9/08/2016</em></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></span></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><br>

When you watch quadrotors flying indoors, if you look closely, you’ll almost always see a motion-capture system in the background: Arrays of external cameras mounted on the walls that work together to collect very precise positional information hundreds of times every second. In this screenshot, you can see part of the camera array, with active IR emitters glowing a scary red to illuminate reflective markers mounted on the quadrotor.With the data that a system like this provides, a computer has no problem issuing very precise commands to a quadrotor flying under remote control to get it to do just about whatever you want. The quadrotor itself is “dumb”: it has no idea where it is or what it’s doing, it’s just following orders, and is completely reliant on all of that external infrastructure to tell it what to do. This new video is different. With research by Giuseppe Loianno from Professor Kumar’s lab, along with Gary McGrath and Chris Brunner from Qualcomm, it features a (very small) quadrotor that’s smart enough to use its own sensors and onboard computation for localization, state estimation, and path planning, allowing it to perform stunts without any help.  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style57"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- IEEE Spectrum, 9/12/2016</em></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></span></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Researchers at North Carolina State University have developed a new type of inverter device with greater efficiency in a smaller, lighter package – which should improve the fuel-efficiency and range of hybrid and electric vehicles. Electric and hybrid vehicles rely on inverters to ensure that enough electricity is conveyed from the battery to the motor during vehicle operation. Conventional inverters rely on components made of the semiconductor material silicon. Now researchers at the Future Renewable Electric Energy Distribution and Management (FREEDM) Systems Center at NC State have developed an inverter using off-the-shelf components made of the wide-bandgap semiconductor material silicon carbide (SiC) – with promising results. “Our silicon carbide prototype inverter can transfer 99 percent of energy to the motor, which is about two percent higher than the best silicon-based inverters under normal conditions,” says Iqbal Husain, ABB Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at NC State and director of the FREEDM Center. “Equally important, the silicon carbide inverters can be smaller and lighter than their silicon counterparts, further improving the range of electric vehicles,” says Husain, who co-authored two papers related to the work. “And new advances we’ve made in inverter components should allow us to make the inverters even smaller still.” Range is an important issue because so-called “range anxiety” is a major factor limiting public acceptance of electric vehicles. People are afraid they won’t be able to travel very far or that they’ll get stuck on the side of the road. The new SiC-based inverter is able to convey 12.1 kilowatts of power per liter (kW/L) – close to the U.S. Department of Energy’s goal of developing inverters that can achieve 13.4 kW/L by 2020. By way of comparison, a 2010 electric vehicle could achieve only 4.1 kW/L. “Conventional, silicon-based inverters have likely improved since 2010, but they’re still nowhere near 12.1 kW/L,” Husain says. The power density of new SiC materials allows engineers to make the inverters – and their components, such as capacitors and inductors – smaller and lighter.

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Robots for the automation of industrial tasks are on the rise in North America, according to a recently-released industry report from the Association for Advancing Automation. More than $800 million in orders were placed in the first half of 2016, setting a new purchasing high for the industry of 14,583 robots. This represents a 2% increase over the same period in 2015, which was itself a record-setter, according to the report. Automotive OEMs and component suppliers were primary drivers for the market. The Association for Advancing Automation (A3), the report's author, is an industry group with the mission to advocate and promote automation technologies. It has three daughter organizations -- Robotic Industries Association (RIA), Motion Control and Motor Association (MCMA), and AIA, a global association for vision information – that support specific technologies used in automation. It is an indication of automation's increasing importance that A3 grew by 119 members this year, for a total of nearly 1000 members in the parent and daughter organizations combined. &quot;Demand for automation technologies is growing,&quot; A3 president Jeff Burnstein told EE Times in an interview. &quot;It's not just a US story but a global one. Lots of companies are trying to become stronger global competitors by improving productivity. And the dull, dirty, and dangerous jobs are the first to be automated.&quot; Burnstein pointed out as examples that the recent rise in robot purchases involved tasks such as materials handling, assembly, welding, and painting. Burnstein also pointed out that robots are becoming easier to incorporate into the workflow, making them increasingly attractive to small and medium-sized companies. &quot;Newer robots are easier to set up,&quot; he noted, &quot;taking only hours of training versus months of programming. They're even being used in final assembly requiring close work with humans, with the development of collaborative robots.&quot; Asked how the rise in robots affects human employment, Burnstein pointed out both robot sales and non-farm employment had been steadily rising before and again since the recession. &quot;We've looked over a 20-year period and when robot sales are rising, unemployment is falling,&quot; he said, &quot;both here and in most of the world.&quot; He also noted that even though there are cycles in industrial spending and employment, as indicated in the graph below, both robot sales and employment are steadily rising. &quot;We can't conclude that robots are killing employment,&quot; Burnstein said</font>.  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style57"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- EE Times, 9/16/2016</em></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></span></font></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Saying they were doing something no other government has done, Obama administration officials rolled out a plan Tuesday they say will enable automakers to get self-driving cars onto the road without compromising safety. In drawing up 112 pages of guidelines, the government tried to be vague enough to allow innovation while at the same time making sure that car makers, tech companies and ride-hailing firms put safety first as the cars are developed. Only time will tell whether the mission was accomplished, but the document generally was praised by businesses and analysts as good guidance in a field that's evolving faster than anyone imagined just a few years ago. &quot;How do you regulate a complex software system?&quot; asked Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. &quot;They want to allow innovation, but they want to be very proscriptive in managing the risk side of this. In my mind, they're trying to manage the unknown.&quot; The guidelines from the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration don't tell companies specifically how to get to an autonomous car that can safely carry people down the road, leaving a lot to interpretation. But they tell companies to explain how they'll comply with a 15-point safety assessment before they roll out the cars. And the guidelines also make clear that NHTSA will force recalls if software doesn't perform as it should. The agency, for the first time in its history, may even seek authority from Congress to approve technology before it goes on the road. &quot;We want to be as nimble and flexible as we can be, recognizing that we will never, ever compromise on what we think is safe,&quot; Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said at a Washington news conference. Among other things, the safety assessment asks automakers to document how the car detects and avoids objects and pedestrians, how the car is protected against cyberattacks and what sort of backup system is in place in case the computers fail. Companies that already have even semi-autonomous vehicles on the road will have to submit assessments four months after the government's 60-day comment period ends. Companies that are developing autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles will be asked to submit assessments before those cars go on the road.</font> <span class="style57"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/21/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></font></font> </font> </span><br>

Now an IEEE Spectrum investigation has discovered that Rose is also CEO of Kindred Systems (aka Kindred AI), a stealthy startup he founded with others in 2014 dedicated to delivering advanced teleoperated and autonomous robots. The goal is making programming robots faster and less costly–and possibly revolutionize the world of work. Kindred has so far received well over US $10 million in funding, according to Data Collective, the venture capital firm that led one of the rounds. Another Silicon Valley VC firm, Eleven Two Capital, also has a stake in the company. In a blog post, Data Collective described Kindred as using “AI-driven robotics so that one human worker can do the work of four.” Kindred has kept a very low profile, issuing no press releases and maintaining only a very basic website. However, last November, Suzanne Gildert, a former D-Wave researcher who is a cofounder and CTO of Kindred, told an audience of technologists that the company was building personal robots that use machine learning to recognize patterns and make decisions. “Quantum mechanics is cool, but humanlike intelligence in robots is cooler,” she is reported as saying. Kindred, based in Vancouver, B.C., Canada, recently filed a U.S. patent application revealing the extent of its ambitions. The document describes a system where an operator wearing a head-mounted display and an exo-suit of sensors and actuators carries out everyday tasks. Data from the suit and from other external sensors is then analyzed by computers in the cloud and used to control distant robots. The data could also be used to train machine learning algorithms that would allow the robots to imitate the operator’s actions autonomously.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style57"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- IEEE Spectrum, 9/22/2016</em></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></span></font><br>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It’s been a week since the Department of Transportation unveiled its ground-breaking policy on autonomous cars. Pretty soon, we expect reality to start sinking in among the auto industry experts who are presumably digesting the DoT’s 116-page document. There are still 50-some odd days to file comments on the new rules. Look for automakers to throw numerous red and yellow cards, on a range of issues suggested in the new document, entitled as “Federal Automated Vehicles Policy.” Protests are likely against the DoT’s demand for pre-market approval for autonomous cars, regulations on post-sale software updates, the inclusion of cybersecurity measures in vehicles, suggestions on data recording/sharing, and on fall-back minimum risk conditions. At first blush, though, most automotive OEMs, interest groups and industry analysts told us last week that the DoT’s new policy document looks “all good.” In particular, we’ve heard little objections to the “15 Point Safety Assessment” outlined by the DoT. This is the vehicle performance guidance the regulators have laid out for automated vehicles so that manufacturers, developers and other organizations can follow it in the design, development, testing and deployment of automated vehicles.But clearly, this isn’t the whole story. Earlier this week, EE Times caught up with Egil Juliussen, director research, Infotainment &amp; ADAS at IHS Automotive, and asked him what jumped out of the government’s new autonomous car policy. <strong>Pre-market approval:</strong> First and foremost, “the biggest news,” Juliussen said, “is that this is the first time the U.S. regulators are suggesting automakers to go through a ‘pre-market approval’” for their new highly automated vehicles (HAVs). Juliussen said, “Simply, this was never done before, because the automotive industry has been always operating under the self-certification system.” What the DoT is proposing is that “your autonomous cars have got to be tested by NHTSA,” said Juliussen. In his view, this is “the most important [policy] change” the DoT is bringing to the automotive industry. This policy revolution is not mentioned in the 15 Point Safety Assessment laid out by the DoT. Instead, it is outlined in just 8 pages in the second half of the document.  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style57"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- EE Times, 9/29/2016</em></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></span></font><br>

    <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Flakes of graphene welded together into solid materials may be suitable for bone implants, according to a study led by Rice University scientists. The Rice lab of materials scientist Pulickel Ajayan and colleagues in Texas, Brazil and India used spark plasma sintering to weld flakes of graphene oxide into porous solids that compare favorably with the mechanical properties and biocompatibility of titanium, a standard bone-replacement material. The discovery is the subject of a paper in Advanced Materials. The researchers believe their technique will give them the ability to create highly complex shapes out of graphene in minutes using graphite molds, which they believe would be easier to process than specialty metals. &quot;We started thinking about this for bone implants because graphene is one of the most intriguing materials with many possibilities and it's generally biocompatible,&quot; said Rice postdoctoral research associate Chandra Sekhar Tiwary, co-lead author of the paper with Dibyendu Chakravarty of the International Advanced Research Center for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials in Hyderabad, India. &quot;Four things are important: its mechanical properties, density, porosity and biocompatibility.&quot; Tiwary said spark plasma sintering is being used in industry to make complex parts, generally with ceramics. &quot;The technique uses a high pulse current that welds the flakes together instantly. You only need high voltage, not high pressure or temperatures,&quot; he said. The material they made is nearly 50 percent porous, with a density half that of graphite and a quarter of titanium metal. But it has enough compressive strength—40 megapascals—to qualify it for bone implants, he said. The strength of the bonds between sheets keeps it from disintegrating in water. The researchers controlled the density of the material by altering the voltage that delivers the highly localized blast of heat that makes the nanoscale welds. Though the experiments were carried out at room temperature, the researchers made graphene solids of various density by raising these sintering temperatures from 200 to 400 degrees Celsius. Samples made at local temperatures of 300 C proved best, Tiwary said. &quot;The nice thing about two-dimensional materials is that they give you a lot of surface area to connect. With graphene, you just need to overcome a small activation barrier to make very strong welds,&quot; he said.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2"><em> -- R&amp;D Mag, 9/02/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></font></font></font><br>

    </strong>Stanford University School of Medicine scientists have identified a brain circuit that's indispensable to the sleep-wake cycle. This same circuit is also a key component of the reward system, an archipelago of interconnected brain clusters crucial to promoting behavior necessary for animals, including humans, to survive and reproduce. It makes intuitive sense that the reward system, which motivates goal-directed behaviors such as fleeing from predators or looking for food, and our sleep-wake cycle would coordinate with one another at some point. You can't seek food in your sleep, unless you're an adept sleepwalker. Conversely, getting out of bed is a lot easier when you're excited about the day ahead of you. But until this study, no precise anatomical location for this integration of the brain's reward and arousal systems has been pinpointed, said Luis de Lecea, PhD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. The researchers' findings will be published online Sept. 5 in Nature Neuroscience. De Lecea is the senior author. The lead author is postdoctoral scholar Ada Eban-Rothschild, PhD. &quot;This has potential huge clinical relevance,&quot; de Lecea said. &quot;Insomnia, a multibillion-dollar market for pharmaceutical companies, has traditionally been treated with drugs such as benzodiazepines that nonspecifically shut down the entire brain. Now we see the possibility of developing therapies that, by narrowly targeting this newly identified circuit, could induce much higher-quality sleep.&quot; Some 25 to 30 percent of American adults are affected by sleep disturbances of one type or another, according to the National Institutes of Health. In addition, disruption of the sleep-wake rhythm typifies many different neuropsychiatric disorders and is understood to exacerbate them. One of the first questions a psychiatrist asks a patient, said de Lecea, is, &quot;How's your sleep?&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/06/2016<br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A new technique invented at MIT can precisely measure the growth of many individual cells simultaneously. The advance holds promise for fast drug tests, offers new insights into growth variation across single cells within larger populations, and helps track the dynamic growth of cells to changing environmental conditions. The technique, described in a paper published in Nature Biotechnology, uses an array of suspended microchannel resonators (SMR), a type of microfluidic device that measures the mass of individual cells as they flow through tiny channels. A novel design has increased throughput of the device by nearly two orders of magnitude, while retaining precision. The paper’s senior author, MIT professor Scott Manalis, and other researchers have been developing SMRs for nearly a decade. In the new study, the researchers used the device to observe the effects of antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides on bacteria, and to pinpoint growth variations of single cells among populations, which has important clinical applications. Slower-growing bacteria, for instance, can sometimes be more resistant to antibiotics and may lead to recurrent infections. “The device provides new insights into how cells grow and respond to drugs,” says Manalis, the Andrew (1956) and Erna Viterbi Professor in the MIT departments of Biological Engineering and Mechanical Engineering and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. The paper’s lead authors are Nathan Cermak, a recent PhD graduate from MIT’s Computational and Systems Biology Program, and Selim Olcum, a research scientist at the Koch Institute. There are 13 other co-authors on the paper, from the Koch Institute, MIT’s Microsystems Technology Laboratory, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Innovative Micro Technology, and CEA LETI in France. <strong>Array of hope: </strong>Manalis and his colleagues first developed the SMR in 2007 and have since introduced multiple innovations for different purposes, including to track single cell growth over time, measure cell density, weigh cell-secreted nanovesicles, and, most recently, measure the short-term growth response of cells in changing nutrient conditions. All of these techniques have relied on a crucial scheme: One fluid-filled microchannel is etched in a tiny silicon cantilever sensor that vibrates inside a vacuum cavity. When a cell enters the cantilever, it slightly alters the sensor’s vibration frequency, and this signal can be used to determine the cell’s weight. To measure a cell’s growth rate, Manalis and colleagues could pass an individual cell through the channel repeatedly, back and forth, over a period of about 20 minutes. During that time, a cell can accumulate mass that is measurable by the SMR. But while the SMR weighs cells 10 to 100 times more accurately than any other method, it has been limited to one cell at a time, meaning it could take many hours, or even days, to measure enough cells.<font size="2"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080"><em> -- MIT News, 9/05/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></font></font><br>

    <font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><font size="3"><font size="3">Several years ago, biologists discovered a new type of genetic material known as long noncoding RNA. This RNA does not code for proteins and is copied from sections of the genome once believed to be “junk DNA.” </font></font>Since then, scientists have found evidence that long noncoding RNA, or lncRNA, plays roles in many cellular processes, including guiding cell fate during embryonic development. However, it has been unknown exactly how lncRNA exerts this influence. Inspired by historical work showing that structure plays a role in the function of other classes of RNA such as transfer RNA, MIT biologists have now deciphered the structure of one type of lncRNA and used that information to figure out how it interacts with a cellular protein to control the development of heart muscle cells. This is one of first studies to link the structure of lncRNAs to their function. “Emerging data points to fundamental roles for many of these molecules in development and disease, so we believe that determining the structure of lncRNAs is critical for understanding how they function,” says Laurie Boyer, the Irwin and Helen Sizer Career Development Associate Professor of Biology and Biological Engineering at MIT and the senior author of the study, which appears in the journal Molecular Cell on Sept. 8. Learning more about how lncRNAs control cell differentiation could offer a new approach to developing drugs for patients whose hearts have been damaged by cardiovascular disease, aging, or cancer.

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As you relax and let your mind drift aimlessly, you might remember a pleasant vacation, an angry confrontation in traffic or maybe the loss of a loved one. And now a team of researchers at Duke University say they can see those various emotional states flickering across the human brain. &quot;It's getting to be a bit like mind-reading,&quot; said Kevin LaBar, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke. &quot;Earlier studies have shown that functional MRI can identify whether a person is thinking about a face or a house. Our study is the first to show that specific emotions like fear and anger can be decoded from these scans as well.&quot; The data produced by a functional MRI hasn't changed, but the group is applying new multivariate statistics to the scans of brain activity to see different emotions as networks of activity distributed across areas of the conscious and unconscious brain. These networks were first mapped by the team in a March 2015 paper in the journal Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience. They identified seven different patterns of brain activity reflecting contentment, amusement, surprise, fear, anger, sadness and neutrality. To build these maps, they had put 32 research subjects into the scanner and exposed them to two music clips and two film clips that had been shown to induce each of the seven emotions. The subjects also completed self-report questionnaires on their mood states for further validation. Analytical software called a machine learning algorithm was then presented with some of the subjects' data and tasked with finding a pattern that concurred with each emotional stimulus. Having learned what each of the seven states ought to look like, the algorithm was then presented with the scans of the rest of the study group and asked to identify their emotional states without knowing which emotion prompt they received. LaBar said the model performed better than chance at this task, despite differences in brain shapes and arousal levels between subjects. &quot;And it proved fairly sensitive,&quot; he said. The latest study, appearing Sept. 14 in Plos Biology, followed up by scanning 21 subjects who were not offered stimuli, but were encouraged to let their minds wander. Every thirty seconds, they responded to a questionnaire about their current emotional state. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/15/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></font></font></font><strong><br>

    </font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A small team of researchers from the University of California and the University of Washington has found that not all of the color-sensing cells in the back of the eyeball actually help us to see color. Instead, as they note in their paper published in the journal Science Advances, some of them sense only white light. A lot of research has gone into studying how the eye works, both in humans and in other animals, and researchers have learned much about the complicated anatomy that allows us to perceive the world in a rich array of colors and shapes. But until now, it has not been possible to study the activity of rods and cones (light sensing cells) in real-time in human volunteers. In this new effort, the researchers have overcome that challenge, and in so doing, have discovered something completely new about cone behavior. To gain a better understanding of the role that cones play in helping us interpret colors, the researchers asked two volunteers to sit still while their eyes were examined by an eye-tracking device based on the same telescope technology that allows astronomers to observe moving stars—called adaptive optics, it keeps the focus of a beam of light on a single point—in this case, on a single cone in the back of the eye. This allowed the researchers to conduct a survey of 273 cones for each volunteer, shining a single beam of light onto each cone and then asking the volunteer what they saw. In so doing, the researchers were surprised to find that approximately two-thirds of the cones did not register a sense of color at all, but instead perceived only white light. Cones come in three varieties, L, M and S, each is able to sense different colors. But the researchers found that for all three types, 77 percent registered as white light sensing. They also found that the cells remained stable over time by testing the same cones over a period of many months—they suggest the purpose of having so many white sensing cells is to help define lines, edges and other details of objects in the world around us. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/15/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font> </font></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The spread of malignant cells around the body, known as metastasis, is the leading cause of mortality in women with breast cancer. Now, a new gene therapy technique being developed by researchers at MIT is showing promise as a way to prevent breast cancer tumors from metastasizing. The treatment, described in a paper published today in the journal Nature Communications, uses microRNAs — small noncoding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression — to control metastasis. The therapy could be used alongside chemotherapy to treat early-stage breast cancer tumors before they spread, according to Natalie Artzi, a principal research scientist at MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) and an assistant professor of medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who led the research in collaboration with Noam Shomron, an assistant professor on the faculty of medicine at Tel-Aviv University in Israel. “The idea is that if the cancer is diagnosed early enough, then in addition to treating the primary tumor [with chemotherapy], one could also treat with specific microRNAs, in order to prevent the spread of cancer cells that cause metastasis,” Artzi says. The regulation of gene expression by microRNAs is known to be important in preventing the spread of cancer cells. Recent studies by the Shomron team in Tel-Aviv have shown that disruption of this regulation, for example by genetic variants known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), can have a significant impact on gene expression levels and lead to an increase in the risk of cancer. To identify the specific microRNAs that play a role in breast cancer progression and could therefore potentially be used to suppress metastasis, the research teams first carried out an extensive bioinformatics analysis. They compared three datasets: one for known SNPs; a second for sites at which microRNAs bind to the genome; and a third for breast cancer-related genes known to be associated with the movement of cells. This analysis revealed a variant, or SNP, known as rs1071738, which influences metastasis. They found that this SNP disrupts binding of two microRNAs, miR-96 and miR-182. This disruption in turn prevents the two microRNAs from controlling the expression of a protein called Palladin.</font>  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080"

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The company announced on Tuesday its plans to ‘solve’ cancer. A team of computer scientists, programmers, and engineers will test A.I. programs to perform a variety of tasks like creating comprehensive models of cells to understand how they communicate with each other or gage how a cancer patient’s system could react to different drugs. One ambitious initiative Microsoft unveiled is its “Moonshot” effort, which is an experiment designed to create a series of biological cells that can be altered and programmed in a manner similar to a computer. Details were vague, but the idea was that these cells could attack cancer and similar diseases. “We built the computer. We know how it works. We didn’t build the cell, and many of its complex internal workings remain a mystery to us. So we need to understand how the cell computes in order to program it,” said Andrew Phillips, Ph.D., in a statement. He’s in charge of Microsoft’s Biological Computation Group. All of these projects are in the early stage of development, but Microsoft’s foray into this field signifies the interest in implementing A.I. to synthesize the tremendous amounts of biological data that is now accessible. “The opportunity lies in the capacity to bring together and embrace the complex data sets that represent human biology in a more illustrative manner. Bringing together molecular, clinical, demographic and real-world data in a manner that provides the end-user the ‘knowledge’ to understand a disease more fundamentally,” BERG Health CEO, President, and Co-founder Niven Narain told R&amp;D Magazine, emphasizing the potential opportunities for a venture like this. Narain’s company is a biotech firm that specializes in creating therapeutic candidates for diseases using artificial intelligence. One drug in particular, BPM 31510, just entered phase 2 trials to study its ability to treat pancreatic cancer. Narain noted though that the challenges for these programs will revolve around “a broader understanding and adoption of A.I. in a mainstream and drug development… [setting]…in addition to gathering the right high quality data sets where true collaboration between groups that can advance validation of the assets to development.” Essentially, programmers would need to develop an efficient program that is easy to use and experts would need to have a strong understanding of the right data points in order to advance these medical projects along.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/21/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></font></font> </font> <br>

The pellets, which contain dozens of enzymes and other molecules extracted from cells, can be stored for an extended period of time at room temperature. Upon the addition of water and freeze-dried DNA, the pellets begin producing proteins encoded by the DNA. “It’s a modular system that can be programmed to make what you need, on the spot,” says James Collins, the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science in MIT’s Department of Biological Engineering and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES). “You could have hundreds of different DNA pellets you can add in the field.” These pellets, a few millimeters in diameter, could be easily carried by soldiers, astronauts, or health care workers heading to remote areas, says Collins, who is the senior author of a paper describing this strategy in the Sept. 22 online edition of Cell. The paper’s lead authors are Keith Pardee, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto and former research scientist at Harvard University’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering; Shimyn Slomovic, an IMES postdoc; Jeong Wook Lee, a Wyss Institute research scientist; and Peter Nguyen, a Wyss Institute Technology Fellow.<strong>  <font size="2"><font color="#000000">Cell-free synthesis</font></font></strong><font color="#000000"><strong>
    : </strong>Collins and many others in the growing field of synthetic biology have previously designed cells to perform many functions they don’t normally have, such as producing drugs or biofuels. Over the past few years, Collins has shown that this kind of design can also be done outside of cells, by extracting the necessary cellular components and freeze-drying them onto paper or other materials. “The cell-free extracts consist of a few dozen enzymes, DNA, and RNA, as well as ribosomes and other molecular machines leading to transcription and translation,” Collins says. In the new study, the researchers took the paper out of the equation: The cellular extracts are simply freeze-dried into pellets, which remain stable for at least a year. To activate protein production, the researchers add water to rehydrate the pellets, along with freeze-dried DNA that encodes the desired protein. </font><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080"

    </font></strong><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A temporary tattoo to help control a chronic disease might someday be possible, according to scientists at Baylor College of Medicine who tested antioxidant nanoparticles created at Rice University. A proof-of-principle study led by Baylor scientist Christine Beeton published today by Nature’s online, open-access journal Scientific Reports shows that nanoparticles modified with polyethylene glycol are conveniently choosy as they are taken up by cells in the immune system. That could be a plus for patients with autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis, one focus of study at the Beeton lab. “Placed just under the skin, the carbon-based particles form a dark spot that fades over about one week as they are slowly released into the circulation,” Beeton said. T and B lymphocyte cells and macrophages are key components of the immune system. However, in many autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, T cells are the key players. One suspected cause is that T cells lose their ability to distinguish between invaders and healthy tissue and attack both. In tests at Baylor, nanoparticles were internalized by T cells, which inhibited their function, but ignored by macrophages. “The ability to selectively inhibit one type of cell over others in the same environment may help doctors gain more control over autoimmune diseases,” Beeton said. “The majority of current treatments are general, broad-spectrum immunosuppressants,” said Redwan Huq, lead author of the study and a graduate student in the Beeton lab. “They’re going to affect all of these cells, but patients are exposed to side effects (ranging) from infections to increased chances of developing cancer. So we get excited when we see something new that could potentially enable selectivity.” Since the macrophages and other splenic immune cells are unaffected, most of a patient’s existing immune system remains intact, he said.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080"

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the future, our health may be monitored and maintained by tiny sensors and drug dispensers, deployed within the body and made from graphene — one of the strongest, lightest materials in the world. Graphene is composed of a single sheet of carbon atoms, linked together like razor-thin chicken wire, and its properties may be tuned in countless ways, making it a versatile material for tiny, next-generation implants. But graphene is incredibly stiff, whereas biological tissue is soft. Because of this, any power applied to operate a graphene implant could precipitously heat up and fry surrounding cells. Now, engineers from MIT and Tsinghua University in Beijing have precisely simulated how electrical power may generate heat between a single layer of graphene and a simple cell membrane. While direct contact between the two layers inevitably overheats and kills the cell, the researchers found they could prevent this effect with a very thin, in-between layer of water. By tuning the thickness of this intermediate water layer, the researchers could carefully control the amount of heat transferred between graphene and biological tissue. They also identified the critical power to apply to the graphene layer, without frying the cell membrane. The results are published today in the journal Nature Communications. Co-author Zhao Qin, a research scientist in MIT’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE), says the team’s simulations may help guide the development of graphene implants and their optimal power requirements. “We’ve provided a lot of insight, like what’s the critical power we can accept that will not fry the cell,” Qin says. “But sometimes we might want to intentionally increase the temperature, because for some biomedical applications, we want to kill cells like cancer cells. This work can also be used as guidance [for those efforts.]” Qin’s co-authors include Markus Buehler, head of CEE and the McAfee Professor of Engineering, along with Yanlei Wang and Zhiping Xu of Tsinghua University.<font size="2"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080"

While surgeons have long performed an operation called a decompressive craniectomy – cutting a hole in the skull to give the swelling brain space to expand – the technique requires a fair amount of guesswork on how best to proceed. “In other parts of the body we can take a small sample of the affected tissue, but you can’t cut out a slice of the brain,” said Ellen Kuhl, a professor of mechanical engineering and member of Stanford Bio-X. “What we’ve begun to develop are simulations to show how the brain reacts to trauma.” Working with Johannes Weickenmeier, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford, and Alain Goriely, a professor of mathematics at the University of Oxford in England, the group recently published a trio of scholarly papers on their work, the latest of which appeared in Physical Review Letters. </font>They describe how the researchers took information from magnetic resonance images and then created mathematical models to predict how certain injuries affect specific parts of the brain, showing extreme damage in red, mild damage in green, and safe areas in blue.</font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080"

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UCLA researchers working with a team at Verily Life Sciences have designed a mobile microscope that can detect and monitor fluorescent biomarkers inside the skin with a high level of sensitivity, an important tool in tracking various biochemical reactions for medical diagnostics and therapy. This new system weighs less than a one-tenth of a pound, making it small and light enough for a person to wear around their bicep, among other parts of their body. In the future, technology like this could be used for continuous patient monitoring at home or at point-of-care settings. The research, which was published in the journal ACS Nano, was led by Aydogan Ozcan, UCLA's Chancellor's Professor of Electrical Engineering and Bioengineering and associate director of the California NanoSystems Institute and Vasiliki Demas of Verily Life Sciences (formerly Google Life Sciences). Fluorescent biomarkers are routinely used for cancer detection and drug delivery and release among other medical therapies. Recently, biocompatible fluorescent dyes have emerged, creating new opportunities for noninvasive sensing and measuring of biomarkers through the skin. However, detecting artificially added fluorescent objects under the skin is challenging. Collagen, melanin and other biological structures emit natural light in a process called autofluorescence. Various methods have been tried to investigate this problem using different sensing systems. Most are quite expensive and difficult to make small and cost-effective enough to be used in a wearable imaging system. To test the mobile microscope, researchers first designed a tissue phantom—an artificially created material that mimics human skin optical properties, such as autofluorescence, absorption and scattering. The target fluorescent dye solution was injected into a micro-well with a volume of about one-hundredth of a microliter, thinner than a human hair, and subsequently implanted into the tissue phantom half a millimeter to 2 millimeters from the surface—which would be deep enough to reach blood and other tissue fluids in practice. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><font color="#808080" size="2"

        face="Arial">In Rohit Karnik’s lab, researchers are searching for tiny solutions to some of the world’s biggest challenges. </font>In one of his many projects, Karnik, an associate professor in MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, is developing a new microfluidic technology that can quickly and simply sorts cells from small samples of blood. The surface of a microfluidic channel is patterned to direct certain cells to roll toward a reservoir for further analysis, while allowing the rest of the blood sample to pass through. With this design, Karnik envisions developing portable, disposable devices that doctors may use, even in remote regions of the world, to quickly diagnose conditions ranging from malaria to sepsis. Karnik’s group is also tackling issues of water purification. The researchers are designing filters from single layers of graphene, which are atom-thin sheets of carbon known for their exceptional strength. Karnik has devised a way to control the size and concentration of pores in graphene, and is tailoring single layers to filter out miniscule and otherwise evasive contaminants. The group has also successfully filtered salts using the technique and hopes to develop efficient graphene filters for water purification and other applications. In looking for water-purifying solutions, Karnik’s group also identified a surprisingly low-tech option: the simple tree branch. Karnik found that the pores within a pine branch that normally help to transport water up the plant are ideal for filtering bacteria from water. The group has shown that a peeled pine branch can filter out up to 99.00 percent of E. coli from contaminated water. Karnik’s group is building up on this work to explore the potential for simple and affordable wood-based water purification systems. “I try to guide my research by long-term sustainability, in a specific sense, by asking myself the question, ‘What can we do today that will have a lasting impact and be conducive to a sustainable human civilization?’ Karnik says. “I try to align myself with that goal.”</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><font color="#808080" size="2"

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ordered patterns of gold nanoparticles on a silicon base can be stimulated to produce collective electron waves known as plasmons that absorb only certain narrow bands of light, making them promising for a wide range of arrays and display technologies in medicine, industry, and science. Materials Processing Center (MPC)-Center for Materials Science and Engineering (CMSE) Summer Scholar Justin Cheng worked this summer in MIT professor of electrical engineering Karl K. Berggren’s Quantum Nanostructures and Nanofabrication Group to develop specialized techniques for forming these patterns in gold on silicon. “Ideally, we’d want to be able to get arrays of gold nanoparticles to be completely ordered,” says Cheng, a rising senior at Rutgers University. “My work deals with the fundamentals of how to write a pattern using electron-beam lithography, how to deposit the gold, and how to heat up the substrate so we can get completely regular arrays of particles,” Cheng explains. In MIT’s NanoStructures Laboratory, Cheng wrote code to produce a pattern that will guide the dewetting of a thin gold film into nanoparticles, examined partially ordered grids with an electron microscope, and worked in a clean room to develop a polymer resist, spin coat the resist onto samples, and plasma clean the samples. He is part of a team that includes graduate student Sarah Goodman and postdoctoral associate Mostafa Bedewy. He was also assisted by the NanoStructures Lab manager James Daley. “Plasmons are collective oscillations of the free-electron density at the surface of a material, and they give metal nanostructures amazing properties that are very useful in applications like sensing, optics and various devices,” Goodman explained in a presentation to Summer Scholars in June. “Plasmonic arrays are very good for visible displays, for example, because their color can be tuned based on size and geometry.” This multi-step fabrication process begins with spin coating hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ), which is a special electron-beam resist, or mask, onto a silicon substrate. Cheng worked on software used to write a pattern onto the resist through electron-beam lithography. Unlike some resists, HSQ becomes more chemically resistant as you expose it to electron beams, he says. The entire substrate is about 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter, he notes, and the write area is about 100 microns (or 0.0001 centimeter) wide.<font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><font color="#808080" size="2"

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nanoengineers at the University of California San Diego, in collaboration with the Materials Project at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), have created the world's largest database of elemental crystal surfaces and shapes to date. Dubbed Crystalium, this new open-source database can help researchers design new materials for technologies in which surfaces and interfaces play an important role, such as fuel cells, catalytic converters in cars, computer microchips, nanomaterials and solid-state batteries. &quot;This work is an important starting point for studying the material surfaces and interfaces, where many novel properties can be found. We've developed a new resource that can be used to better understand surface science and find better materials for surface-driven technologies,&quot; said Shyue Ping Ong, a nanoengineering professor at UC San Diego and senior author of the study. For example, fuel cell performance is partly influenced by the reaction of molecules such as hydrogen and oxygen on the surfaces of metal catalysts. Also, interfaces between the electrodes and electrolyte in a rechargeable lithium-ion battery host a variety of chemical reactions that can limit the battery's performance. The work in this study is useful for these applications, said Ong, who is also part of a larger effort by the UC San Diego Sustainable Power and Energy Center to design better battery materials. &quot;Researchers can use this database to figure out which elements or materials are more likely to be viable catalysts for processes like ammonia production or making hydrogen gas from water,&quot; said Richard Tran, a nanoengineering PhD student in Ong's Materials Virtual Lab and the study's first author. Tran did this work while he was an undergraduate at UC San Diego. The work, published Sept. 13 in the journal Scientific Data, provides the surface energies and equilibrium crystal shapes of more than 100 polymorphs of 72 elements in the periodic table. Surface energy describes the stability of a surface; it is a measure of the excess energy of atoms on the surface relative to those in the bulk material. Knowing surface energies is useful for designing materials that perform their functions primarily on their surfaces, like catalysts and nanoparticles. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><font color="#808080" size="2"

However, most nanoparticles that have been developed so far are limited to carrying only one or two drugs. </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MIT chemists have now shown that they can package three or more drugs into a novel type of nanoparticle, allowing them to design custom combination therapies for cancer. In tests in mice, the researchers showed that the particles could successfully deliver three chemotherapy drugs and shrink tumors. In the same study, which appears in the Sept. 14 issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society, the researchers also showed that when drugs are delivered by nanoparticles, they don’t necessarily work by the same DNA-damaging mechanism as when delivered in their traditional form. That is significant because most scientists usually assume that nanoparticle drugs are working the same way as the original drugs, says Jeremiah Johnson, the Firmenich Career Development Associate Professor of Chemistry and the senior author of the paper. Even if the nanoparticle version of the drug still kills cancer cells, it’s important to know the underlying mechanism of action when choosing combination therapies and seeking regulatory approval of new drugs, he says.“People tend to take it as a given that when you put a drug into a nanoparticle it’s the same drug, just in a nanoparticle,” Johnson says. “Here, in collaboration with Mike Hemann, we conducted detailed characterization using an RNA interference assay that Mike developed to make sure the drug is still hitting the same target in the cell and doing everything that it would if it weren’t in a nanoparticle.” The paper’s lead authors are Jonathan Barnes, a former MIT postdoc; and Peter Bruno, a former MIT graduate student. Other authors are grad students Hung Nguyen and Jenny Liu, former postdoc Longyan Liao, and Michael Hemann, an associate professor of biology and member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. </font> <font size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2"

A number of manufacturing techniques like chemical vapor deposition have been used to try and control these dimensions. However, these manufacturing techniques require tailor-made, multi-step reactions and purification procedures that are difficult to generalize. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have developed a far more generalized approach that allows the production of many different kinds of one-dimensional nanorods from a wide range of precursor materials. The key to the technique is the use of block copolymer “arms” to create nanometer-scale compartments that serve as chemical reactors. The outer blocks of the arms prevent the aggregation of the nanorods. Block copolymers are sequences of one type of monomer (a molecule that binds to other molecules to form a polymer) that are bound to sequences of another monomer and have the ability to self assemble into defined arrays of nanostructures covering macroscopic areas. The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors predicted as early as 2007 that block copolymers would be needed in order to proceed to the next generation of computing. The block copolymers that the Georgia Tech team used to produce the nanorods resemble tiny bottlebrushes, which explains why they have been dubbed bottlebrush-like block copolymers (BBCPs). “We have developed a very general and robust strategy to craft a rich variety of nanorods with precisely-controlled dimensions, compositions, architectures and surface chemistries,” said Zhiqun Lin, a professor at Georgia Tech, in a press release. “To create these structures, we used nonlinear bottlebrush-like block copolymers as tiny reactors to template the growth of an exciting variety of inorganic nanorods.” <font size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2"

These nanowires are often used in nanoelectronic applications. The research, which appears in the online edition of Chemical Communications and on the cover of the hardcopy issue, shows how the method can yield large quantities of long, uniform, high-purity copper nanowires. High-purity copper nanowires meet the requirements of nanoelectronic applications as well as provide an avenue for purifying industrial-scale synthesis of copper nanowires, a key step for commercialization and application. Metal nanowires (NWs) hold promise for commercial applications such as flexible displays, solar cells, catalysts and heat dissipators. The most common approach to create nanowires not only yield nanowires but also other low-aspect ratio shapes such as nanoparticles (NPs) and nanorods. These undesired byproducts are almost always produced due to difficulties in controlling the non-instantaneous nucleation of the seed particles as well as seed types, which causes the particles to grow in multiple pathways. &quot;We created the purest form of copper nanowires with no byproducts that would affect the shape and purity of the nanowires,&quot; said LLNL's Fang Qian, lead author of the paper. The team demonstrated that copper nanowires, synthesized at a liter-scale, can be purified to near 100 percent yield from their nanoparticle side-products with a few simple steps. Functional nanomaterials are notoriously difficult to produce in large volumes with highly controlled composition, shapes and sizes. This difficulty has limited adoption of nanomaterials in many manufacturing technologies.</font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2"

        face="Arial"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Empirical evidence is continuing to pile up confirming that so-called topological insulators—materials that behave as conductors near their surfaces but act as insulators throughout the bulk of their interiors—do exist. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, researchers at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), in cooperation with the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Physics of Solids, in Germany, have produced a new type of topological matter. It can carry an electrical current on its surface at room temperature and then get that electrical current to transport itself to the other side of the material. The key to performing this trick was producing nanoscale slices of a material called cadmium arsenide, an inorganic semimetal that is a semiconductor. What is intriguing about cadmium arsenide is that it exhibits some of the same electronic properties as graphene. Researchers from Oxford, Stanford, and the University of California, Berkeley discovered in 2014 that electrons within cadmium arsenide act as though they have no mass at all, just as they do in graphene. But unlike graphene, cadmium arsenide is a stable 3D material that is comparatively easy to produce in bulk and simple to fabricate for use in electronic devices. In research described in the journal Nature, the team used focused-ion beams to shape the cadmium arsenide so that electrons rotated around one side of the material as if they were on a racetrack and then traveled through the bulk of the material to rotate on the other side. One of the implications for this kind of movement is the ability to transport charge and energy through a material without loss. “This had been theorized by Andrew Potter [an assistant physics professor at the University of Texas at Austin] on our team and his coworkers, and our experiment marks the first time it was observed,” said James Analytis, a staff scientist at Berkeley Lab and assistant professor of physics at UC Berkeley, in a press release. Analytis, who led the research, added that “it is very unusual—there is no analogous phenomena in any other system. The two surfaces of the material ‘talk’ to each other over large distances due to their chiral nature.”<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2"

        face="Arial"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MIT researchers have designed nanosensors that can profile tumors and may yield insight into how they will respond to certain therapies. The system is based on levels of enzymes called proteases, which cancer cells use to remodel their surroundings. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once adapted for humans, this type of sensor could be used to determine how aggressive a tumor is and help doctors choose the best treatment, says Sangeeta Bhatia, the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. “This approach is exciting because people are developing therapies that are protease-activated,” Bhatia says. “Ideally you’d like to be able to stratify patients based on their protease activity and identify which ones would be good candidates for these therapies.” Once injected into the tumor site, the nanosensors are activated by a magnetic field that is harmless to healthy tissue. After interacting with and being modified by the target tumor proteins, the sensors are secreted in the urine, where they can be easily detected in less than an hour. Bhatia and Polina Anikeeva, the Class of 1942 Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, are the senior authors of the paper, which appears in the journal Nano Letters. The paper’s lead authors are Koch Institute postdoc Simone Schurle and graduate student Jaideep Dudani. <strong>Heat and release: </strong>Tumors, especially aggressive ones, often have elevated protease levels. These enzymes help tumors spread by cleaving proteins that compose the extracellular matrix, which normally surrounds cells and holds them in place. In 2014, Bhatia and colleagues reported using nanoparticles that interact with a type of protease known as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to diagnose cancer. In that study, the researchers delivered nanoparticles carrying peptides, or short protein fragments, designed to be cleaved by the MMPs. If MMPs were present, hundreds of cleaved peptides would be excreted in the urine, where they could be detected with a simple paper test similar to a pregnancy test. In the new study, the researchers wanted to adapt the sensors so that they could report on the traits of tumors in a known location. To do that, they needed to ensure that the sensors were only producing a signal from the target organ, unaffected by background signals that might be produced in the bloodstream. They first designed sensors that could be activated with light once they reached their target. That required the use of ultraviolet light, however, which doesn’t penetrate very far into tissue. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2"

    </strong>    <font size="3">Researchers at Google may unveil a truly powerful quantum computer by the end of next year. While Google itself remains tight-lipped on timings, New Scientist reports that many researchers in the field reckon its team isn’t far from completing perhaps the most advanced quantum device the world has seen. “It’s Google’s to lose,” Simon Devitt, from the Riken Center for Emergent Matter Science in Japan, told the magazine. The new report confirms what we reported last year after visiting Google’s hardware lab. It’s no secret that Google is striving to build a quantum computer that can outperform conventional computers—a concept known as quantum supremacy. Having tested—with no small amount of controversy—D-Wave’s quantum computers, the company hired acclaimed physicist John Martinis in 2014 to build its own quantum chips. More recently, it published results which suggested that a powerful quantum computer might be easier to build than was previously thought. Several scientists familiar with Google’s progress, including Devitt, suggest that a functioning 50-qubit quantum chip, enough to overpower conventional supercomputers at a certain kind of calculation, could be ready by as soon as the end of 2017. Demonstrating quantum supremacy would mark an inflection point in the history of computing technology. The first machines would be unlikely to be of much practical use, but they would almost certainly trigger a huge amount of investment in developing quantum computers that could blow away today’s supercomputers in almost every type of calculation imaginable.  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- Technology Review, 9/01/2016</em></font></font></font><br>

The two companies have not disclosed the transaction cost. Just four mo</font>nths ago, EE Times posted a blog entitled “Will Intel’s Drone Chips Fly?” In that blog, referring to Intel’s depth sensing technology called RealSense, Remi El-Ouazzane, Movidius CEO called the technology “a world-class, quality depth solution.” At that time, El-Ouazzane also told us: “Practically all the chip companies currently in the drone market —Intel, Qualcomm, Nvidia and Movidius included—are going after the same target: Autonomous drones.” For Intel, however, this is not just about entering the drone and robot markets. <strong>Computer vision, deep learning, AI: </strong>More significantly, the processor giant is intent on taking the “lead in providing computer vision and deep learning solutions -- from the device to the cloud,” as Josh Walden, Intel’s senior vice president responsible for New Technologies Group, put it in his blog. Indeed, Intel has recently devoured a number of startups whose technologies are focused on deep learning, computer vision and artificial intelligence. They include: RealSense (depth-sensing technology), Nervana Systems (a specialized chip designed specifically for deep learning AI applications), Saffron (a leading cognitive computing platform provider). Earlier this year, Intel also acquired Ascending Technologies, a German drone company with sense-and-avoid algorithms. Movidius, founded in 2006, is the latest on a list of recently acquired tech companies that will report to senior vice president Walden's New Technologies Group. Movidius’ VPU (Vision Processing Unit) platform has earned a solid reputation, allowing the startup to form partnerships with established companies ranging from Google to DJI, FLIR and Lenovo. Movidius’ mission thus far has been in “giving sight to smart devices including drones, security cameras, AR/VR headsets and more,” explained El-Ouazzane.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- EE Times, 9/06/2016</em></font></font><strong><br>

But they suffer from low energy-storage capacity and other drawbacks, meaning they mostly serve as backup power sources for things like electric cars, renewable energy technologies, and consumer devices. </font>But MIT spinout FastCAP Systems is developing ultracapacitors, and ultracapacitor-based systems, that offer greater energy density and other advancements. This technology has opened up new uses for the devices across a wide range of industries, including some that operate in extreme environments. Based on MIT research, FastCAP’s ultracapacitors store up to 10 times the energy and achieve 10 times the power density of commercial counterparts. They’re also the only commercial ultracapacitors capable of withstanding temperatures reaching as high as 300 degrees Celsius and as low as minus 110 C, allowing them to endure conditions found in drilling wells and outer space. Most recently, the company developed a AA-battery-sized ultracapacitor with the perks of its bigger models, so clients can put the devices in places where ultracapacitors couldn’t fit before. Founded in 2008, FastCAP has already taken its technology to the oil and gas industry, and now has its sights set on aerospace and defense and, ultimately, electric, hybrid, and even fuel-cell vehicles. “In our long-term product market, we hope that we can make an impact on transportation, for increased energy efficiency,” says co-founder John Cooley PhD ’11, who is now president and chief technology officer of FastCAP. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- MIT News, 9/07/2016</em></font></font></font><br>

IC Insights, for one significant example, just released an updated IoT semiconductor market report in which it has trimmed back its own forecast. </font>IC Insights reduced the IoT semiconductor market’s projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) — between 2014 and 2019 — from an original projection of 21.1 percent to 19.9 percent. Hence, semiconductor sales for IoT system functions in 2019 are now expected to reach $29.6 billion in 2019, instead of $31.1 billion, according to IC Insights. The market research firm’s slimmed IoT market forecast was triggered by lower sales projections for connected cities applications, said IC Insights. The connected cities segment, as IC Insights defines it, include smart electric meters and infrastructure. The new outlook shows that semiconductor revenues for connected cities applications are projected to grow by a CAGR of 12.9% between 2014 and 2019, down from 15.5% in the original forecast. Rob Lineback, senior market research analyst at IC Insights, said, “The connected cities category is large because it was backed by economic stimulus efforts earlier this decade in Europe, China, U.S., etc.” However, he added, “It's growing slower than other segments, partly because of belt tightening by governments that had funded and provided incentives and the maturing of the smart meter segment.” IC Insights breaks down the IoT market in five segments: connected cities, connected vehicles, wearable systems, connected homes and industrial Internet. Asked how IC Insights defines IoT semiconductor content inside systems, Lineback said, “We count everything in a system that’s essential to connectivity to Internet.” He said, “Obviously, it is sometimes a bit of judgement call, but what’s essential is the connection part.” IC Insights sometimes include sensors [in the IoT semiconductor mix] if sensors are served by cloud computing. “We count them in IoT semiconductors because if a system isn’t connected to the Internet, those sensors wouldn’t be there.” Lineback, however, noted, “We do not consider smartphones as IoT devices.” Nor, in his book, is Smart TV.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em> -- EE Times, 9/08/2016</em></font></font><br>

Their process is but one example of the future of semiconductors, now that the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS 2015) has declared 10-nanometer the last &quot;Moore's Law&quot; node, with future chip progress depending on More than Moore innovations such as 3-D, new channel materials and novel architectures like Zeno Semi's. Disclosed today at the European Solid State Device Research Conference (ESSDRC 2016, Lausanne, Switzerland) the boosted transistor paper was a collaborative effort among Zeno Semi, Synopsys, and Stanford University, titled A CMOS-Compatible Boosted Transistor Having &gt;2x Drive Current and Low Leakage Current. It follows the one-transistor SRAM presented by Zeno last year. Zvi Or-Bach is an investor and executive chairman at Zeno Semiconductor, as well as a frequent contributor to EE Times, but the idea behind Zeno's breakthrough technology came from the principle author of the ESSDRC paper, namely Jin-Woo Han. &quot;Jin-Woo Han was picked for one of Obama's young scientists awards while at NASA,&quot; Or-Bach told EE Times. Han's 2016 award was for nanodevices and nano-electronics at the Universities Space Research Association of Washington, based at NASA's Ames Research Center (Moffett Field, Calif.) Basically Han discovered how to have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too by inventing a transistor architecture that could operate as either a low-power metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) or could instantly switch to a high-power bipolar-junction transistor (BJT). &quot;Han's transistor operates in two modes, one in low bias for low power by reducing its operating voltage, and the other a high-power mode with a higher bias voltage for better speed and higher power driving capabilities,&quot; OrBach told EE Times. Zeno Semi owns the dual-mode transistor intellectual property (IP), which it intends to license to all comers. Called βMOS, it allows users stay at their current low-cost scaling node (or even drop back a node or two for die savings). All the while reaping even more benefits than are achieved by using the advanced nodes (which come at a premium price due to lower yields and the ballooning prices of fab equipment). The Han βMOS transistor operates between 0.6-and-1.0 volts, with good performance and low power at the lower voltage setting which grows exponentially (squared) as it approaches 1-volt where it achieves twice the drive and four times the power-delay factor. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- EE Times, 9/14/2016</em></font></font><br>

      <font size="3">Off-the-shelf autonomy systems are likely to be an important route to market for self-driving vehicle technology. But, somewhat surprisingly, the first may be available by the end of the year. Comma.ai, the automotive startup founded by George Hotz, first announced that it was working on a bolt-on autonomy system earlier this year. Now the company is planning to launch a system that can be added to regular cars by the end of the year, according to TechCrunch. When it goes on sale, the Comma One will cost $999, though users will also have to pay a $24 monthly subscription for software. The company doesn’t claim that the unit will turn a car into a fully autonomous vehicle. Instead, it will provide a vehicle with the ability to automatically accelerate, brake, and change lanes on the highway. The device, shrouded in brilliant green plastic, adds only camera sensors to the car. For more data about what’s happening on the road, the Comma One uses radar systems, currently found on higher-end cars to aid intelligent cruise control systems. As a result, the new product will initially be compatible with only a handful of models. As for how well it works? “It’s about on par with Tesla Autopilot,” Hotz told TechCrunch. In contrast to many others involved with self-driving projects, the company is clearly focused on building a commercial product as soon as possible—and in that sense, at least, its sensibilities are more closely aligned with those of Tesla. Indeed, it will probably be quicker to market than others who plan to offer off-the-shelf autonomy packages—among them Delphi, Mobileye, and Oxbotica. Clearly, Hotz doesn’t think much of some of his competition. “If you’re looking to Mobileye to build the software of the future—don’t,” he said. Safety worries will no doubt be difficult for Comma.ai to avoid. Concerns over the safety of Tesla’s Autopilot system continue to linger following a fatal crash earlier this year, though the automaker did announce this week that it will update the system’s software to make better use of radar data and provide “a threefold improvement in safety.” </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- Technology Review, 9/14/2016</em></font></font></font></font><font size="3"><br>

    The telecom industry needs to move quickly past the first generation of NFV, where existing hardware elements are simply virtualized as software, and into the stage in which virtual functions are broken down into simpler pieces of software and managed as part of a cloud services portfolio, AT&amp;T's Tom Anschutz said here Tuesday. Speaking at Light Reading's NFV &amp; Carrier SDN event, the distinguished member of technical staff at AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE: T) said the early virtual network functions were hardware functions that vendors virtualized and delivered as software that could run on an x86 server. That was fine for an initial step, Anschutz said, but it created bundles of functions that couldn't be broken down, which limited flexibility. That approach also didn't do anything to simplify management as every vendor's ported software was still managed by its existing element management system, which allowed for rapid adoption but maintained vendor lock-in, he said.  &quot;If I had a packet gateway and it was a bundle of functions, the software did the same bundle of things,&quot; he explained. &quot;That's okay but it stifles the ability to re-use those functions in other applications.&quot; In the next round of virtualization, things such as routers and gateways must be broken down into smaller functions, with software re-architected to meet future business requirements, he said. That means creating what is, in essence, a catalog of software functions that can be assembled as needed and delivered via a flexible cloud infrastructure in an on-demand, self-service way. Hardware needs to be set up as cattle, not pets -- i.e., easily replaceable commodity systems that don't require special treatment, Anschutz explained. </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- Light Reading, 9/14/2016</em></font></font></font></font><font size="3"><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">A new startup will emerge from stealth mode and into the super-heated market for machine learning next week. Wave Computing will describe a chip that can train neural networks ten times faster than Nvidia’s top GPUs while consuming the same power. Wave’s chip is one of a handful of announcements at next week’s Linley Processor Conference. Also at the event, Ceva will describe a new DSP core for computer vision, Adesto will detail a NOR chip that can handle both storage and execute code and ARM will announce a new member of its family of on-chip interconnects. The news comes at a time of growing specialization in microprocessor design, according to the event’s host, veteran chip analyst Linley Gwennap. “In the 1970’s and ‘80’s people created a lot of different architectures, but over the past 20 years work has consolidated more on to ARM and x86,” said Gwennap, principal of the Linley Group. “As Moore’s law slows, Intel can’t keep delivering twice the performance every two years, so people have to innovate at the architectural level again…and we will see more custom accelerators with special instruction sets to get a 10x boost in performance,” he said. Wave is the poster child for that trend at this year’s event, showing a custom chip for accelerating the TensorFlow algorithm Google developed and designed its own ASIC to run. “We’ve looked at their architecture, and it looks very innovative, their preliminary performance numbers are 10x better than traditional GPUs in the same power as a high-end Nvidia GPU,” Gwennap said. “It’s a hot space, and they have a similar business model to Nervana [recently acquired by Intel] of selling systems to accelerate machine learning,” he added. The systems approach makes sense given the difficulty of attracting the $50-100 million needed for a new chip startup and the higher revenues for selling systems, Gwennap noted. Indeed, even Nvidia is trying to sell machine learning systems that use four of its high-end Pascal-class processors. Among other newsmakers, Adesto will describe a NOR chip with a special interface geared to speed output of programs executed on it. Typically flash is too slow to execute programs, so engineers provide SRAM, generating unacceptable costs for Adesto’s target markets in wearables and the Internet of Things. For its part, ARM will detail a more feature rich on-chip interconnect. However it is not expected to support all the bells and whistles of offerings from companies such as Arteris and Netspeed.</font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- EE Times, 9/21/2016</em></font></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">Chances are you’ve never seen a fully autonomous self-driving car out on the street. But if you have, you probably couldn’t help but notice the distinctive spinning sensor adorning its roof. It’s what helps an autonomous vehicle understand the world around it, but it’s also what’s keeping autonomous vehicles from being affordable enough for the average consumer to buy. Lidar (light radar) is complex and expensive right now, but within the next few years, it’ll be cheaper and more reliable—and everywhere. Lidar is a sensing technology similar to radar that detects objects with pulses of laser light. Though lidar has a shorter range than radar (tens to hundreds of meters), the much shorter wavelengths used by lidar result in a massive increase in resolution. The uniquely reliable and high-quality data that lidar provides has made it the sensor of choice for the majority of vehicle autonomy applications. In fact, many experts feel that lidar is a necessity for driverless cars. “Lidar is a critical sensor for driverless vehicles because it enables highly precise and robust localization across a wide range of conditions,” explains Karl Iagnemma, CEO of nuTonomy, a -Cambridge, Mass., startup that is currently testing self-driving cars in -Singapore. But Iagnemma points out that the size, complexity, and cost of the current generation of lidar sensors are significant obstacles to the commercialization of any technology that depends on them. Many autonomous cars have relied on the HDL-64E lidar sensor from Silicon Valley–based Velodyne, which scans 2.2 million data points in its field of view each second and can pinpoint the location of objects up to 120 meters away with centimeter accuracy. But the sensor itself weighs more than 13 kilograms and costs US $80,000. This year, Velodyne announced the VLP-32A, which offers a 200-meter range in a 600-gram package. With a target cost of $500 (at automotive scale production), the VLP-32A would be two orders of magnitude cheaper than its predecessor but still too expensive to be integrated into driverless cars intended for the consumer market.A substantial amount of recent academic and industry research has been focused on making lidar sensors smaller, easier to manufacture, and cheaper. At the CES 2016 electronics show, Quanergy Systems, in Sunnyvale, Calif., demonstrated a prototype solid-state lidar sensor designed for driverless cars. It uses an optical phased array to steer laser pulses rather than a rotating system of mirrors and lenses. Quanergy projects that its sensor will cost $250 in volume production, and it should be available to automotive original equipment manufacturers in early 2017.

    <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial">Jodie O’Connell-Ponkos used a prosthetic arm for five years, until the day she threw it across the room in frustration. “Hate was an understatement,” recalls O’Connell-Ponkos, who lost part of her right arm in an industrial meat grinder at the age of 16 in 1985. She didn’t use another prosthesis for 20 years. </font>O’Connell-Ponkos’ story is common among upper-limb amputees: Despite advances in engineering and availability, the rate of users abandoning upper-limb prosthetics hadn’t changed in 25 years as of 2007, with up to 75% of users rejecting electric prosthetics. One of the reasons may be that despite better materials, more powerful motors and additional joints, upper-limb prostheses still relied on controls developed in the 1950s. These used either body-powered maneuvers involving clunky cables and harnesses or myoelectric systems, which use electronic sensors resting on the skin of the amputation site to detect muscle activity and translate that activity into motion. The clenching of a bicep, for example, might bend an artificial elbow. It wasn’t intuitive, and often required extensive practice. Then, last year, O’Connell-Ponkos tried a prosthetic arm enhanced with an new control system that can recognize subtle nerve signals, built by Chicago-based engineering company Coapt. Unlike the prosthesis she used as a teenager, the new arm allowed her to move more naturally, even gracefully. Today, the outgoing horse trainer wears the prosthesis constantly, relying on it for everything from chopping wood to putting her hair in a ponytail.</font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- IEEE Spectrum, 9/22/2016</em></font></font></font><br>

    <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A long-heralded update to Tesla Motor’s Autopilot has just been made available for download. First reports suggest that it’s as big a change in the semiautonomous driving system as Tesla CEO Elon Musk had promised. One key element of the upgrade is making more use of the car’s existing radar capabilities, both to perceive the road in real time and to map it so that subsequent Tesla cars can distinguish earlier fixed features from new, perhaps threatening ones. Another key element is saving drivers from over-dependence on the software. Either of those points might have saved the Tesla owner who died last May when his Autopilot, apparently unsupervised by the driver, drove into the side of a tractor trailer. That is the first fatality known to have been caused by a modern robotic driving system. “We believe it would have seen a large metal object across the road,” Musk said in a conference call earlier this month, referring to the trailer. “Knowing that there is no overhead road sign there, it would have braked.” (Another Tesla driver died in China in January, in a case now under litigation there, but it isn’t clear whether the Autopilot was operating at the time of the crash.) Tesla’s preference for radar over lidar, the laser-ranging equivalent, makes the company a little unusual in autoland. Lidar has far better resolution—unlike radar it can see road markings and make out the shapes of signs and other things even at a distance.</font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- IEEE Spectrum, 9/22/2016</em></font></font></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Connecticut hasn't become the Silicon Valley of bioscience quite yet, but five years after lawmakers made a massive investment to support the development of that industry, there is a thriving hub in Farmington. Eighteen technology or bio-medical startups recently set up shop inside new laboratories at the Cell and Genome Science Building on the University of Connecticut Health campus. The labs are being leased to the companies as part of the university's Technology Incubation Program, which is designed to help bioscience and tech companies start and grow in Connecticut. They were built using $19 million in funding from Bioscience Connecticut, the almost $900 million bonding initiative championed by Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy in 2011. &quot;We're making the kind of investments that quite frankly should have been made decades ago,&quot; Malloy said Thursday, during the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the laboratories. &quot;We know that a lot of companies can be started here. Now, we're going to be concentrating on starting them here, having them grow here and keeping them here.&quot; That initiative has included major renovations to the school's hospital and the relocation of the Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine to the UConn Health campus. The work being done at UConn and Jackson has helped breed the startup companies such Shoreline Biome, LLC, which is developing a product to help doctors and researchers map microbes in the bodies of their patients and test subjects. UConn's incubation program has helped Shorline Biome with everything from equipment, to accountants, to business planning experts, to student interns and venture capital contacts.</font> <span class="style57"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2"><em>-- R&amp;D Mag, 9/26/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></span><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a cross-industry alliance, Audi, BMW and Daimler along with telecommunications equipment providers Ericsson, Huawei and Nokia as well as semiconductor vendors Intel and Qualcomm will bundle their R&amp;D resources to evolve, test and promote communications solutions for connected mobility. The efforts will focus on the development of 5G mobile technologies. The “5G Automotive Association” announced to develop, test and promote communications solutions, support standardization and accelerate the commercial availability of such solutions. Users will benefit in that the solutions will improve connected mobility and safety, ubiquitous access to services and integration of services with smart cities and intelligent transportation solutions. And of course, the technology to be developed will also address autonomous driving. The 5G mobile networks the partners plan to roll out will also include V2X applications – but not on the basis of the widespread IEE 802.11p standard currently favored by many players. But instead it is based on mobile networks, cloud connectivity and cellular connectivity (C-V2X). Since future applications in the connected car, the technologies to be developed also hold out the prospect of ending the bandwidth bottleneck of today’s mobile networks. In addition, 5G promises much shorter latency. Thus, it can better support mission-critical functions for safer driving and will further support enhanced vehicle-to-everything communications and connected mobility solutions. These new solutions bring also new technological and business opportunities for both the automotive and ICT industries, the members of the association said in a joint press release. The association will address key technical and regulatory issues, leveraging next generation mobile networks and integrating vehicle platforms with connectivity, networking and computing solutions. ? The main activities of the alliance will include the defining and harmonizing use cases and technical requirements, driving the standardization process, and running joint R&amp;D projects with the goal of integrated solutions, interoperability testing, and large scale pilots. Another important topic for the member is addressing automotive connectivity requirements including security and privacy aspects as well as distributed cloud architectures. The organization is open for further interested parties; according to the press release, several companies already have declared their intent to join the Association soon. ?</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style57"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2"><em>-- EE Times, 9/28/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></span></font><br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Qualcomm is in talks to buy NXP Semiconductors for more than $30 billion, according to multiple press reports. The reports have driven NXP’s stock up about 15% to an estimated market capitalization of about $33 billion. If the deal goes ahead, it could become one of the largest in a historic period of consolidation in semiconductors. NXP itself completed in December its merger with Freescale Semiconductors that it valued at $40 billion. A combination of the two companies could vie with TSMC as the world’s third largest semiconductor company with annual revenues of nearly $27 billion, according to rankings by IC Insights. They would still be significantly below #2 ranked Samsung at about $40 billion. The deal would propel Qualcomm into the embedded and automotive markets where it is seeking inroads amid declining growth in its core smartphone market. NXP was named the largest chip supplier to car makers in an analyst report that said it had a 14.2% share of the $27.4 billion automotive semiconductor market in 2015. One financial analyst spoke in upbeat terms about the deal’s potential but noted it would create “considerable integration/execution risks,” in a noted quoted in a report from the Wall Street Journal. Neither NXP nor Qualcomm responded immediately to requests for information about the reports. The maturing chip industry racked up more than $100 billion in M&amp;A deals last year and more than $50 billion so far this year. Softbank paid $32 billion for ARM in this year’s biggest deal to date. Last year Avago bid $37 billion to acquire Broadcom in a deal that closed in March. The M&amp;A craze has been driven by a search for growth as revenue growth declines and the job of making smaller, faster chips becomes increasingly complex. One analyst recently reported he expects semiconductor revenues could fall next year for the third straight year. <span class="style57"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2"><em>-- EE Times, 9/29/2016</em></font></font></font></font></font></font></font> </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></span><br>

    <font size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Intel’s Chris Croteau and Oakley’s Luiz Dias met with me this week to show off the Radar Pace smart glasses that will hit stores this Saturday, but they were careful to downplay expectations for this new consumer wearable technology. The smart glasses, designed jointly by Intel and the Luxottica Group (Oakley is a subsidiary), are “really just for runners and cyclers,” they kept pointing out. “We spent a long time trying to understand what kind of wearables athletes want, and designed this for them,” they emphasized. And, they told me several times, “we’re not trying to be Google Glass.” “We’re concerned about avoiding social awkwardness,” chimed in Scott Smith, a vice president at Luxottica, Oakley’s parent company. Still, Radar Pace’s little voice in your ear—one that knows exactly what you’re doing and encourages you to do it a little better—has a bit of the flavor of the virtual companion in the movie Her. It’s going to be very tempting to go beyond the questions it expects (Am I on my target pace? How’s my stride length?), to getting a little chattier (I think I know that guy who just ran past. Should I say hello?). In fact, Radar Pace strays into the territory of audio augmented reality, an area with huge potential that’s getting little attention as we obsess about visual AR like Pokemon Go. And Croteau, in spite of trying to focus on sports training, wouldn’t argue with that perception. “It is indeed AR,” he says. “We are augmenting the reality of an athlete through audio.” OK, so what is Radar Pace, really? It is a version of Oakley’s Radar sunglasses, long popular with cyclists for their comfort, clarity, and durability. The standard Radar frame has been kitted out with a Bluetooth radio, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a pressure sensor, a humidity sensor, a proximity sensor, three microphones, earbuds, and an embedded processor that acts as a sensor fusion hub. According to Croteau, who leads Intel’s head-worn device projects in the company’s New Technology Group, all this gear adds just a tiny bit of weight to the standard Radar glasses; he didn’t say how much, but the total mass of the Radar Pace frames is 56 grams. On the software side, Intel is introducing its own natural voice package called Intel Real Speech with this product; it currently understands five languages.</font></font>  <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Arial"><em>-- IEEE Spectrum, 9/30/2016</em></font></font></font><br>
